I ' m going to want to stretch that out before we get to Homestead .
England beat Paraguay 1-0 in a bruising encounter among the shadows of the Commerzbank Arena , Frankfurt , Saturday .
in the sunshine and heat , which reached 30 degrees Celsius , it became a physical game that saw three bookings and the referee frequently blowing his whistle .
England got the perfect start scoring after just 3 minutes from a David Beckham freekick .
swung in from the left of the field , the ball clipped the head of Paraguayan captain Carlos Gamarra on its way to the net .
both sides looked nervous and no side got control of the midfield .
passes were frequently misplaced and attacks from both teams lacked cutting edge .
Paraguay lost number one goalkeeper Justo Villa to an injury in the sixth minute of the game .
missing Wayne Rooney , arguably their team ' s most skilled player , whose recent injury though healed had ruled him out for this match , the noisy England fans in the crowd did n 't have much to sing about except the victory .
England ' s Swedish manager Sven-Göran Eriksson ' s side had more possession but failed to score more than the one early goal .
on their part , Paraguay was unable to capitalize on a number of English defensive errors to get an equaliser .
England next face Trinidad and Tobago while Paraguay face the England manager ' s home nation , Sweden .
a Virgin Trains train traveling at high speed collided with a car near Copmanthorpe , Yorkshire , England , killing the car ' s driver .
the accident took place at approximately 20 : 55 GMT when the Class 220 / 221 train , traveling at close to 100mph , hit the car which was on the tracks .
the train then partially derailed but remained upright , coming to a stop further down the tracks .
the car driver is believed to have been killed instantly .
North Yorkshire Police said that the car had left the road , driven through a fence and ended up on the track .
the train was the 14 : 25 Virgin Voyager cross-country service from Plymouth to Edinburgh Waverley , capable of speeds up to 125mph , but was deccelerating on approach into York .
the line between York and Leeds was closed for several hours , delaying other services .
Virgin Spokesman Arthur Leathley told reporters that Network Rail hoped to have three of the four lines in that section of the track operational by Tuesday morning .
a deadly hotel bombing in Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia , has killed at least fifteen people , including three Somali Cabinet ministers , earlier today .
the blast targeted a university graduation ceremony being attended by a number of government officials .
the Shamo Hotel was hosting a graduation ceremony for Benadir University .
eyewitnesses reported that a suicide bomber gained access to the venue dressed as a woman , donning a full abaya and a veil .
the attacker was wearing an explosive strapped to his torso , but was not patted down by security .
the director of Median Hospital , Ali Yusuf , commented that `` forty people with shrapnel wounds , including students and medical doctors , have been hospitalized today .
former Islamic Courts Union members at the scene identified the bomber , whose head and face had been completely shaven , as a member of al-Shabab , the ultra-conservative Islamist group believed to have links to al-Qaeda .
Somali Health Minister Qamar Aden Ali , Education Minister Ahmed Abdullahi Waayeel , and Higher Education Minister Ibrahim Hassan Adow were killed in the attack on Hotel .
Abdulkadir Mohamed Osman , the Somali presidency ' s director of information , commented on the incident .
the blast rocked inside the hotel , killing three ministers and wounding another one . ' '
Adow served as the foreign secretary of the insurgent Islamic Courts Union when it took power in 2006 .
the Somali minister for sports is also reported to be hospitalized and in critical condition .
Mohamed Mohamoud , an attending graduate of the ceremony , said that he personally saw the remains of the health minister on the ground , as well as the corpses of other government officials .
they have been studying in such a horrific environment , and today they passed away without benefiting from their education .
two journalists , a reporter for Radio Shabelle and a cameraman with al-Arabia TV , were also found dead from the explosion .
the National Union of Somali Journalists has issued a statement condemning the attack and expressing outrage at the loss of their colleagues .
Somalia is one of the world ' s most dangerous places for journalists to work .
eight have been killed in Somalia since the beginning of 2009 .
hotel Shamo is often chosen by government officials to host events and at one time was a popular lodging option for foreign journalists .
Recently-released Canadian journalist Amanda Lindhout and Australian photojournalist Nigel Brennan were staying at the hotel before their capture last year .
the hotel security staff say that they were kicked out of the room prior to the ceremony , as government security officials wanted sole handling of the event .
the government officials were attending the graduation of 43 students from the local Banadir University .
the official death toll from the blast is expected to continue to rise , with some reports indicating that more than 60 people have been found dead .
the attack is the latest in a string of incidents linking al-Shabab to common insurgent tactics used by Islamist terrorist groups in other parts of the world .
until recently , suicide bombings were an unusual practice in Somalia .
in September , al-Shabab claimed responsibility for a bold attack on a meeting between government officials and the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia , known as AMISOM , which killed 17 peacekeepers , including the top Burundian commander .
two vehicles containing explosives were given entry to the AMISOM base and subsequently blew up .
the rebel group is battling for control of the war-ravaged nation against the Western-backed Transitional Federal Government , led by former Islamic insurgent Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed .
rebel groups control much of southern and central Somalia , as well as significant portions of Mogadishu .
the government is being bolstered by the continuing presence of the peacekeeping force composed of Ugandans and Burundians .
the AMISOM forces are mandated with the protection of key city sites such as the airport , seaport , and presidential palace .
Sir Richard Branson , successful British entrepreneur , better known as the founder of the Virgin brand , has made a suggestion to the next British chancellor to both save MG Rover , the largest independent manufacturer of cars in England until it collapsed this spring , and help with rapidly rising oil demand .

a 7-year old Tennessee boy who was eager to get his driver ' s license got an early education when he decided to take his parents pick-up truck for a joyride .
the boy , whose name was not released , remembered to wear his seatbelt and even used his turn signal when he was supposed to .
police chasing the boy initially thought they were chasing a drunk driver .
he could n 't stay in his lane , ' ' Officer Josh Laverette said .
but when the truck came to a stop in front of a house , police saw that it was a boy , a second grader , barely 4 feet tall , behind the wheel .
`` He was so short he had to sit up close to the steering wheel , ' ' Laverette said .
`` Whenever he would brake , he would pick himself up with his left foot and stomp on the brake with his right . ' '
when police began to talk to the boy , who managed to park in front of his own home , `` He said the reason he took the vehicle was because he wanted to get his license , ' ' said Laverette .
`` There were like probably five city cars and three county cars and a state trooper ' ' all of which were chasing the pickup , said Susan Daniel , a witness to the incident .
`` It blew my mind because we actually watched him put on his turn signal and turn , and we could see when he went past that he had seat belts on , ' ' Daniel said .
`` Then to come find out it was a child , I was really shocked . ' '
the boy was charged with driving without a license , eluding police and leaving the scene of an accident .
he is expected to appear in juvenile court next week .
the Italian dailies La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera are reporting that US forces may not have been informed of the operation to rescue kidnapped Italian journalist , Giuliana Sgrena , in which the intelligence agent Nicola Calipari was killed by US troops .
the Italian government disputes this account , and has said that the US was fully aware of the operation on March 4 .
La Repubblica is reporting that US forces were aware of Italian intelligence agent Nicola Calipari ' s presence , but not the specific details of his mission .
speaking in the La Repubblica newspaper , General Mario Marioli assisted those involved in the operation in Baghdad , by obtaining a special badge for them from coalition forces upon their arrival .
however , as the deputy commander of the coalition forces in Iraq , Marioli reported that he was unaware of Calipari ' s purpose in Iraq , so he could not tell coalition troops on the ground the details of the Italian mission .
according to La Repubblica , Marioli reported that he `` had no contact with US intelligence officers ' ' prior to the shooting .
the People ' s Republic of China has signed an agreement with ASEAN to establish the world ' s largest free trade area .
Japan , South Korea , New Zealand , India and Australia are considering joining .
ASEAN members include Myanmar , Laos , Thailand , Cambodia , Vietnam , Philippines , Malaysia , Brunei Darussalam , Singapore and Indonesia .
in the last four years China has become a major importer of oil and commodities , and a major exporter of finished goods .
China has also strengthened relationships with oil suppliers in the Middle East and Africa .
this pact lifts trade restrictions and removes tariffs from many imports and exports .
it also allows China to continue manipulating the value of its currency in its own interests .
the yuan is currently undervalued , making Chinese-made goods artificially cheap for foreign importers .
stated in the agreement is ASEAN ' s intention to create a unified economy -- and by implication polity -- similar to the EU .
this agreement will cement China ' s role as the center of the South Asian regional economy , and at the same time strengthening bonds between China and other countries in the region and ease their suspicions over a growing superpower .
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun separately adopted accords with the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations , agreeing to launch the talks early next year .
Australia and New Zealand are expected to sign similar agreements with ASEAN before discussions close later Tuesday , although ASEAN remains wary of Australian Prime Minister John Howard ' s refusal to sign its nonaggression treaty .
Howard played down these concerns but said on record that he reserves the right to preemptively act against terrorists on foreign soil if they threaten Australia .
Pakistani officials have said that five attacks on government sites across the country have killed at least forty people .
the latest attack occurred late on Thursday at a government residential area in Peshawar .
officials said they suspect Taliban militants for being responsible for the attacks .
authorities said that the situation in the eastern city of Lahore was under control , following separate attacks on the country ' s Federal Investigation Agency -LRB- FIA -RRB- and two police training centers .
gunmen with at least one suicide jacket stormed the FIA building at mid-morning .
the FIA is an agency responsible for investigating matters relating to terrorism and immigration .
early last year , the building was the target of a suicide truck bomb that killed more than 20 people .
`` Reportedly , four men attacked the FIA building and initial reports are that two of them have been killed , ' ' said the provincial interior secretary , Nadeem Hassan Asif Punjab .
soon after the assault on the FIA began , gunmen targeted two police training centers on the outskirts of Lahore .
in the suburb of Manawa , gunmen targeted a center that militants attacked earlier this year .
in the other incident , attackers with suicide jackets in Bedian climbed over a wall to gain access to the Elite Force Training Center .
it took several hours before security forces were able to gain control of all the sites .
the attacks in Pakistan ' s east took place hours after a suicide car bomber targeted a police station at a garrison town about an hour ' s drive from the northwestern city of Peshawar .
speaking to local media , Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said intelligence agencies had expected attacks on security sites in the country and that authorities will remain on high-alert .
he said the recent violence shows the militants want to bring the frontlines from Pakistan ' s violent northwest to Punjab province .
on Saturday , militants with ties to Punjab , as well as the South Waziristan tribal region , assaulted the Pakistani army ' s headquarters in Rawalpindi .
Pakistani intelligence officials believe the attacks are a reaction to the military ' s raids on South Waziristan .
the military is expected to launch a full-scale assault on Taliban militants in the region bordering Afghanistan .

the man had been sitting in a chair for two years and was physically fused to it when he was discovered by two roommates , one of which was his girlfriend .
authorities who arrived at the house in Bellaire reported seeing the man sitting amidst his own urine and feces , which were infested with maggots .
the man ' s skin had become attached to the recliner ' s cloth , said law enforcement officers , one of whom had to dispose of his uniform after responding to the home .

British MPs on the Commons Environmental Audit Committee warn Britain could face widespread electrical blackouts if new generating capacity is not added soon .
clean and renewable generating methods will be preferred in the Government ' s energy review , including a return to nuclear power generation .

meanwhile nearly a quarter of Britain ' s current generating capacity is scheduled to go offline by 2016 , creating a shortfall described by the committee as a `` generation gap ' ' which could not be bridged by nuclear energy .
`` Very substantial investment in new generating capacity and energy efficiency will be required if the lights are to stay on , ' ' committee chairman Conservative MP Tim Yeo said .
the committee stated that an `` extensive ' ' building program of new gas-fired power stations would be needed to meet the predicted shortfall .

Interpol has issued an `` Orange Notice ' ' for the leader of southeast Asian Jemaah Islamiyah , Mas Selamat bin Kastari , who escaped from a detention center Wednesday .
Singapore Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng told his Parliament that a `` security lapse ' ' is what led to Mas Selamat ' s escape .
while waiting to visit his family , Mas Selamat escaped from the Internal Security Department ' s Whitley Road detention facility shortly after 4 PM local time after being granted permission to use the washroom .
the escape led to Mr. Wong apologizing for the incident and the beginning of an island-wide manhunt for Selamat .
`` When it comes to escapes , the first hours are crucial , ' ' said Jean-Michel Louboutin , Interpol ' s executive director of police services .
`` The state of Singapore has put into operation everything that ' s needed to be done .
it ' s a small country , so it ' s easy to cross and leave . ' '
Selamat , a 47-year-old former bus mechanic and a father of 5 , was once accused of plotting to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore ' s international airport .
he is `` someone who presents a potential physical danger to others , but also a potential danger by organizing future bombings , ' ' Louboutin said .

on Friday , May 27 , 2005 , 9 trains on the New York City Subway will make their final run , ending rush-hour skip-stop service on the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line north of 137th Street-City College .
during rush hours , the 9 is a skip-stop supplement to the 1 , running the same route but skipping some stops in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx .
at the same time , the 1 skips other stops , which are only served by the 9 at rush hours ; some stops are served by all trains .
this service pattern results in slightly faster trains , but longer waits for those going to or from skipped stations .
9 service was started on December 12 , 1988 , at first running during rush hours and middays .
a train , traveling at a high rate of speed , was carrying over 850 passengers when it rammed into an empty train near Rio de Janeiro .
the empty train was in the process of being moved between sets of tracks .
officials are currently putting the death toll at eight , and at least 70 others are seriously hurt .
`` We have to use blowtorches to open the sides of the train cars to reach the people , ' ' said Pedro Machado , commander general of the Rio de Janeiro Fire Department .
`` Our priority is to give support to the survivors , the passengers trapped in the wreckage , and reduce the number of fatal victims , ' ' said Col. Souza Filho , the head of Rio de Janeiro ' s Civil Defense Department in an interview with the Globo TV network .
`` They had fractures in their arms , their faces , everywhere , ' ' said Marcos de Souza , director of the Posse Hospital in a televised interview .
he said the hospital does have a large emergency ward but they are bringing in extra personnel to treat collision victims .
six media organizations , including Fairfax , are mounting a constitutional challenge to secret hearings in an upcoming terrorism trial in Australia .
the trial involves Sydney man Faheem Khalid Lodhi , who is charged with committing acts in preparation for a terrorist attack .
Lodhi is accused of conspiring with French terror suspect Willie Brigitte to attack Sydney ' s military bases and electricity supply network .
federal Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock will issue a certificate to prevent information judged to be sensitive from reaching the public at Lodhi ' s trial .
the Federal Attorney-General has the powers to do this under the National Security Information -LRB- Criminal and Civil Proceedings -RRB- Act .
the grounds for the challenge are that National Security Information legislation violates the separation of executive and judical powers , required by the Australian constitution .
Tom Blackburn , SC , counsel for the media groups mounting the challenge claims that the act allows for the federal executive to intrude into judicial matters by ordering parts of the trial are kept secret .
the challenge will be heard on 31st January 2006 by Justice Anthony Whealy of the Supreme Court of NSW .
in the course of Lodhi ' s trial , towards the end of December Justice Anthony Whealy ruled that evidence and pre-trial matters are to remain secret .
a federal judge ruled Monday that the controversial morning-after pill Plan B must be made available without a prescription to girls as young as 17 , citing the Food and Drug Administration ' s -LRB- FDA -RRB- willingness to concede to the Bush administration ' s conservative influences by setting the age limit to 18 in 2006 .
plan B , available in the United States since 1999 , consists of two pills designed to prevent conception and must be taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse .
only since 2006 has it been available without a prescription , following lobbying from the World Health Organization and American Medical Association .
currently the drug is only available without a prescription to women over the age of 18 .
the lawsuit was filed in 2005 by the Center for Reproductive Rights .
in the ruling , the judge blasted the FDA for giving in to `` political considerations ' ' and delaying approval of the new age limit .
Susan F. Wood , former director of women ' s health at the FDA , resigned in 2005 in protest over the agency ' s handling of the drug .
`` What happened with Plan B demonstrated that the agency was off track , and was not being allowed to do its job properly , ' ' she said .
the Family Research Council , a conservative organization , said the judge had given in to `` political ideology promoting sexual license for teens . ' '
the FDA says it is reviewing the ruling , which it has thirty days to comply with .
a 600 lb bomb which was found in Northern Ireland has been defused by a bomb disposal team .
the bomb was found on the side of a road near the village of Forkhill in County Armagh , Northern Ireland , close to the border with the Republic of Ireland .

in proceedings by the Guantanamo military commission at the United States Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on Monday , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four alleged co-conspirators stated that they will confess and plead guilty to the charges they face in the planning and execution of the September 11 attacks in 2001 .
the defendants announced their intentions in court , with Stephen R. Henley reading their filing .
he also said it was `` our earnest desire ' ' to admit guilt and said he wanted the proceeding to end because `` I do not trust Americans . ' '
Mohammed also expressed displeasure that it took over a month for the court to address his filing requesting `` an immediate hearing session to announce our confessions . ' '
in court he said , `` I do n 't know -- are the military commissions using carrier pigeons or what ? ' ' speaking in English .
the judge would not accept pleas from Binalshibh and al-Hawsawi , ordering mental competency hearings for the two .
Al Hawsawi objected and told the judge he decided to plead guilty `` with all my complete mental capacity and voluntarily . ' '
however , Mohammed told the judge they would not enter their pleas without Binalshibh and al-Hawsawi , `` We want everyone to plead together . ' '
after the competency evaluations , another hearing will be held , where the five may enter their pleas .
presiding Officer Stephen Henley asked for briefs from prosecutors on whether the military commission can `` accept a plea of guilty to a capital offense . ' '
Monday ' s hearing was unusual in that , in addition to the press , the families of five 9 / 11 victims were also in attendance .

the World Health Organization , Rotary International , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF are leading the Initiative and coordinating a series of overlapping immunization campaigns in the region .
in 2004 Afghanistan , India , and Pakistan cut their number of Polio cases by 45 % .
in 2005 the goal is to cut the number of cases by 100 % .
the three countries are the last in Asia to have endemic polio , and the disease is confined to a small number of regions within the country .
only 186 cases were reported in 2004 , down from 336 the previous year .
the United States military Strategic Command -LRB- STRATCOM -RRB- has said that the ` fireballs ' spotted over areas of Texas in the United States on Sunday February 15 , are not related to the collision of a U.S. and Russian satellite in space .
according to spaceweather.com , NASA says the object was a meteor .
`` There is no correlation between the debris from that collision and those reports of re-entry , ' ' said STRATCOM military spokeswoman Major Maj. Regina .
`` It ' s a natural meteor , definitely , ' ' said Bill Cooke , an astronomer at NASA ' s Meteoroid Environment Office .
on Tuesday , February 10 , the American civilian communications satellite Iridium 33 , launched in 1997 , and the defunct Russian military communications satellite Kosmos-2251 , launched in 1993 , collided over Siberia .
on Friday February 13 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- issued an alert for falling debris from the satellites , following reports of `` explosions and earthquakes ' ' along with `` flashes in the sky ' ' in Jackson and Louisville , Kentucky .
then again on Sunday , calls to 9-1-1 began to come in to Williamson County , Texas sheriff ' s office around 12 : 30 p.m. -LRB- Central time -RRB- that burning debris and fireballs were seen falling from the sky onto parts of Austin , Houston , Waco and San Antonio .
`` The Federal Aviation Administration -LRB- FAA -RRB- reported to local law enforcement on Friday that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris . ' '
`` These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms , resulting in vibrations felt by some residents , as well as flashes of light across the sky , ' ' said the NOAA on Friday in an public information alert posted on their website .
the FAA says the burning material over Texas is not related to this alert .
residents in Texas reported their homes and windows shaking and large explosions on Sunday morning .
after a search of several areas , the Williamson county sheriff ' s office reported that no debris or impact sites were found .
earlier unconfirmed reports had said the debris could have been the result of a small plane exploding .
there was previous speculation was that the object in Texas could have been a meteor .
doctor Marco Ciocca , a professor at Eastern Kentucky University told WKYT on Sunday that it ' s too early for the debris from the satellites to be reentering the planet ' s atmosphere .
' ' [ it could ] be months ' ' before any of the satellite wreckage enters the earth ' s atmosphere .
`` It will either vaporize or stay in orbit for some time before falling into earth ' s atmosphere . ' '
however , the Union of Concerned Scientists -LRB- UCS -RRB- said on February 12 that the debris could have taken 10 days or less to reenter over portions of the planet .
`` Within 24 hours of the collision , the U.S. space tracking system had identified 600 pieces of debris . ' '
`` This large number suggests that the collision must have been relatively head-on . ' '
`` If the two satellites hit head-on , rather than a glancing blow , the energy of the collision would completely disintegrate both satellites into clouds of debris , ' ' said the UCS in a statement on their website who also added that the collision took place in `` the same region of space where China destroyed a defunct Chinese weather satellite with an anti-satellite -LRB- ASAT -RRB- weapon ' ' in 2007 .
`` That January 2007 test created a massive amount of debris . ' '
there have been at least eight major satellite collisions since 1991 .
the satellites , both of which had a mass in excess of 450 kilograms , and were traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour -LRB- 28,150 km / hour -RRB- , collided 491 miles -LRB- 790 km -RRB- above the earth .
scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive .
they are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the earth will be affected .
the results of a plotting analysis will be posted to a public website .
new research published in the journal Nature Medicine has shown a link between a faulty gene and migraines .
scientists hope that this discovery will lead to improved pain management treatments for sufferers , with possible benefits for pain treatment generally .
the breakthrough involves a gene known as TRESK , thought to control the brain ' s reaction to pain : if it is defective , then many normal activities and actions will be painful .
Migraine sufferers -LRB- thought in the United Kingdom to number about eight per cent of men and eighteen per cent of women -RRB- often complain that light , noise and touch cause pain .
TRESK can potentially be affected by drugs that would change the point at which it reports pain , which would alleviate the suffering of those with migraines .
the study involved scientists from the Medical Research Council Functional Genomics Unit at the University of Oxford and from Canada .
they looked at the DNA of 110 people with migraine and members of their family , and found that TRESK was a major component in migraines .
one of the Oxford researchers , consultant neurologist Zameel Cader , described it as a `` once in a generation find ' ' and said that it could `` potentially lead to a treatment for pain in general . ' '
before this study , no genes had been directly linked to migraines , although parts of the DNA that raised the general risk had been found .
migraines are described by the World Health Organisation as a major worldwide cause of disability .
in Britain , it is estimated that migraines affect 20 per cent of the population , with about 190,000 migraines occurring daily and over 25 million lost days from work every year .
Lee Tomkin , director of a sufferers ' charity , Migraine Action , described the news as `` fantastic ' ' and `` genuinely a really great step forward . ' '
professor Peter Goadsby from the Migraine Trust termed it `` a novel direction to consider new therapies in this very disabling condition . ' '
with studies suggesting the existence of life on Mars , the new system may soon see implementation .
Paraguay beat Trinidad and Tobago in a match that had no effect on the qualifiers through to the round sixteen of the Fifa World Cup , Tuesday .
Paraguay edged the game from start to finish and got a goal in each half .
Trinidad and Tobago could manage just two shots to trouble Aldo Bobadilla in the Paraguay net .
Kelvin Jack , who started his first Fifa World Cup game , made seven saves .
after 25 minutes Jack was a bystander when Roberto Acuna ' s freekick was driven hard into the box .
Jack ' s central defender Brent Sancho inadvertently directed the ball goalbound with his head .
the goal that sealed the game for the South Amercians was scored six minutes from time by Nelson Cuevas after he had exchanged passes with Roque Santa Cruz .
the game was notable for being the last appearance for Carlos Gamarra , 35 , for his national side .
after three games the Group B table was topped by England with seven points and then Sweden with five points with Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago going out of the competition .
the Common Council requested on Tuesday that a picture be found on what many thought was the site of a previous hotel .
the Proposed Elmwood Village Hotel would be placed on the intersection of Elmwood and Forest .
it was suspected by residents and business owners in the area that hotel once stood in the same spot .
the Elmwood Village hotel is a proposed development by Savarino Construction Services Corp. .
after some research , a freelance journalist writing for Wikinews was able to determine that there was never a hotel on the proposed Elmwood Village Hotel site .
however ; there was a temporary hotel located on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest .
Buffalo was the host of the Pan-American Exposition from May 1 until November 2 , 1901 .
it was a fair designed to feature the latest in technology , including electricity .
there was a midway , athletic events , and had African , Eskimo , and Mexican villages .
however ; what is likely the most famous event that took place at the exposition was the assassination of then President William McKinley on September 6 , 1901 .
he was shot by Leon Czolgosz just outside the Temple of Music and died eight days later while in the home of John Milburn on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo .
just a short time later , Theodore Roosevelt was inaugurated on September 14 , 1901 at the Wilcox House on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo .
during that time several hotels and rooming houses were built around the exposition including The Elmwood at 717 Elmwood , the Hotel Elmhurst at Forest and Lincoln Parkway , Hotel Gibbs 1005-1021 Elmwood , the R. Palmerton Merritt at 441 Forest and The Norman at 422 Forest .
probably the most famous hotel that was built during the exposition was the Statler ' s Pan-American Hotel built by Ellsworth Milton Statler .
a freelance journalist writing for Wikinews has obtained the only known reproduction photo of the hotel [ pictured at the top ] .
the hotel stood on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo , had 2,100 sleeping rooms and accommodations for 5,000 .
at the time , the Statler was the largest hotel [ based on the number of rooms ] ever constructed .
it was three stories high , plastered on the inside , made mostly of wood and was covered with ornamental staff on the outside , which made it semi-fireproof .
every room was an outside room and was well lighted and ventilated .
it was located within one block of the exposition ' s main entrance .
the Statler was built for only one thing , the exposition .
work began in 1900 and finished just before the beginning of the exposition .
when the exposition ended in November , the hotel was taken down .
maps from 1894 show that there was no hotel , let alone any buildings or houses on the intersection .
however ; research did show that the homes 1119-1121 Elmwood , the buildings that would be demolished to build the Elmwood Village Hotel , were built sometime before 1915 but were not on the intersection prior to 1902 .
based on research conducted at the Buffalo Historical Society , it was concluded that between the years of 1890 and 1902 , no other major hotel existed in the area .
in fact , research had shown that almost every hotel built in the area , existed only during the time of the exposition .
research also indicated a hotel or a rooming house at 1089 Elmwood around 1901-1903 .
the only known name of the hotel was the John C. Hill Hotel .
the hotel was in the house now called the Atwater House .
the house was the first house to be built on the east side of the block .
the Atwater House is currently vacant and owner Pano Georgiadis wants to demolish it to expand his restaurant .
the house was built by 1894 and the original owner and builder of the house is currently unknown .
its earliest known occupant was Edward Atwater who in 1862 founded the oil refinery company of Atwater & Hawes in Buffalo .
the site of this company was recently uncovered in the Canal District during an archeological dig .
at the moment , current research does not show any connection between the two men .
numerous cities throughout Texas , United States have begun broadening their efforts to fight mosquito populations , in an effort to reduce transmission of the sometimes-lethal West Nile virus .
officials in Dallas county have declared a public health emergency .
officials there have requested use of five planes , intended to spray most of North Dallas , as well as other sections of the city .
Tim Whitley , a city official in Malakoff , told Wikinews his city has begun using a pesticide specialist to spray two times weekly .
according to Whitley , certain atmospheric conditions , such as wind speed and humidity , must be right before the large scale treatments can occur .
he explained two treatments per week is more often than usual for the city .
`` With the concerns in Dallas , we ' re taking it seriously ' ' , Whitley added .
even in the drier climate found in Abilene , mosquitos recently tested were carrying the virus .
as a result , that city has increased its pesticide treatments .
media sources indicate well over 80 cases of West Nile virus have been reported this year in Dallas county alone .
a top-ranking Dallas county official told media he views the problem with serious concern .
there have been nine cases of West Nile virus in the Houston region , with one of those resulting in death .
a New Jersey woman who is a former resident of Lubbock told media earlier this month she ' d contracted the virus and believed she ' d been bitten while visiting Austin .
about 60 percent of West Nile cases in the U.S. happen in Texas .
historically , there have been some objections raised over aerial spraying and the potential health hazards distributing such chemicals may pose .
a California study , however , showed evidence that in areas where aerial spraying occurred , infection was six times less likely to occur .
the earliest cases of the virus appeared in the U.S. in the late 1990s .
initial results gave Afghan President Hamid Karzai more than the 50 % of votes necessary to re-elect him in the country ' s recent presidential elections .
however , after a month of speculation about vote-rigging , officials from the United Nations-backed Electoral Complaints Commission -LRB- ECC -RRB- have discounted ballots from 210 polling stations .
European Union observers have claimed that as many as one in four votes may be in doubt .
the Afghanistan ECC has published a report about their investigation into allegations which emerged after the polls two months ago .
the EEC has stated that there was `` clear and convincing evidence of fraud ' ' at polling stations throughout the country .
as the ECC reports to the Independent Election Commission -LRB- IEC -RRB- no official announcement has been made yet , although by law the IEC is obliged to accept the EEC findings ; however foreign diplomats have suggested that the IEC may not accept the findings .
President Karzai has refused to accept the investigation ' s findings , which reduce his share of the vote from around 55 % to under 50 % , leading to what Mohammad Moin Marastyal , one of the campaign team members , describes as `` deadlock ' ' .
Marastyal claims that the EEC deliberately altered the facts to force a runoff .
`` Effort has been made to lower Karzai ' s vote to below 50 per cent , ' ' he stated .
the 2008 Taipei Game Show , organized by the Taipei Computer Association -LRB- TCA -RRB- , ended on Monday , and was different from shows of past years .
this could be seen in the gaming population , industry , and exhibition arrangements .
the Indonesian province of Aceh was struck by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake at 3 : 08 PM local time -LRB- 8 : 08 AM GMT -RRB- .
the epicentre was 319 km -LRB- 198 miles -RRB- off the coast of Sumatra , close to the island of Simeulue .
at least three people have been killed and several buildings have been damaged .
the same region was hit by an earthquake in 2004 , that triggered a tsunami .
according to local citizens the quake lasted about one minute and was felt in Banda Aceh , the province capital , approximately 300 km -LRB- 185 mls -RRB- away , also in Meulaboh and Gunung Sitoli on Nias island .
the U.S. Geological Survey , that reported the earthquake , says that no local tsunami warning has been issued .
minutes after the quake hit , the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning that parts of the Sumatran coast were at risk of a possible tsunami but was later canceled .
Japan ' s meteorological agency said India ' s Andaman and Nicobar island chain was also at risk .
Indonesia ' s meteorology and geophysics agency recorded at least two aftershocks about 20 minutes after the first tremors , one measuring 5.5 and the other 5.3 on the Richter scale .
Budi Waluyo , an official at the National Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said the quake occurred about 30 kilometres beneath the ground .
the US Geological Survey measured the quake at 7.6 on the Richter scale .
`` The quake has no tsunami potential because it ' s happening under the ground , not the sea , ' ' Waluyo said .
it just was n 't their day for the two baseball teams on either side of the Straight , as China Stars and Uni-President Lions were both eliminated in a route at the Konami Cup 2007 .
the final of Konami Cup will take place between SK Wyverns and Chunichi Dragons .
lead poisoning has taken the lives of at least 163 individuals in the northern Nigerian state of Zamfara in recent weeks .
sometime during March residents of remote villages began illegally mining gold in areas of high lead concentration .
there have been a total of 355 reported cases , setting the fatality rate at 46 % .
according to Henry Akpan , chief epidemiologist at Nigeria ' s Ministry of Health , 111 of the 163 recorded deaths have been children , many only several years old .
Akpan further said that officials had seen young children playing in contaminated water located near the mining sites .
the government had found through their yearly immunization program that there were almost no children living in the villages of Zamfara .
adults from the area reported that the children had died of malaria .
however , after an investigation , health officials concluded that there was an abnormally large amount of lead circulating in the villagers ' bodies .
Nigeria ' s government has requested assistance from international organizations , including the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , in averting a widespread outbreak .
the Ministry has meanwhile organized two camps for villagers suffering from the poison .
the South African government has reported that former President Nelson Mandela has been discharged from a hospital in Pretoria , where he was hospitalised December 8 .
Mandela received hospital treatment for gallstones and a lung infection .
presidential spokesperson Mac Maharaj said Mandela `` will undergo home-based high care at his Houghton home until he recovers fully ' ' .
Mandela was hospitalised for eighteen days , his longest hospitalisation since 1990 , when he was released from prison after 27 years .
current president Jacob Zuma visited Mandela in hospital this past weekend .
Zuma visited Mandela again on Christmas , as did Graca Machel , Mandela ' s wife .
Mandela has been hospitalised three times since the start of last year .
in January 2011 , Mandela received hospital treatment for an acute respiratory infection .
work at a Robben Island limestone quarry , where he was imprisoned for sixteen years during South Africa ' s Apartheid , damaged his eyes and lungs .
during the 1980s , while still a prisoner on Robben Island , he developed .
Maharaj , once a political prisoner alongside Mandela during Apartheid , expressed thanks for public and media support and allowing Mandela privacy .
on behalf of the government , Maharaj also asked for a `` continuation of the privacy in order to allow for the best possible conditions for full recovery ' ' .
according to the Bureau of Meteorology , -LRB- BOM -RRB- 2005 was the hottest year since reliable , widespread temperature observations became available in 1910 .
data collected by the Bureau show Australia ' s annual mean temperature for 2005 was 1.09 ° C above the standard 1961-90 average .
the Bureau of Meteorology says the result is more evidence of climate change .
the Bureau ' s Blair Trewin said : `` We ' ve seen things like the general retreat of the winter snow line . ' '
`` We ' ve seen a marked decrease in the frequency of frost , especially in inland Queensland , ' ' Dr Trewin said .
`` We ' ve seen an increase in the number of extreme hot days . ' '
`` All the projections we have from climate models we would expect to see continued warming through the 21st century , ' ' he said .
`` Numbers like this ... are another piece of evidence that climate change is real and it ' s a real issue . ' '
despite unseasonably cool weather in the South West of Western Australia , 2005 was a hot year over most of the nation , with the Northern Territory -LRB- NT -RRB- bearing the brunt .
the NT area-average maximum temperature was 1.45 ° C above the long-term mean , the largest anomaly of any state or territory .
the Bureau says that while these temperature departures may seem relatively small , a 1 ° C increase in mean temperatures is equivalent to many southern Australian towns shifting northward by about 100km .
all States and Territories , apart from Victoria and Tasmania , recorded 2005 mean temperatures amongst their top two warmest years on record .
the only region recording a cooler than normal year was a coastal strip of Western Australia extending from Cape Leeuwin to Carnarvon .
Australia ' s previous warmest years on record were influenced by significant El Niño events , say the Bureau .
however , no such event occurred in 2005 , making the record warmth even more unusual .
since 1979 , all but four years have been warmer than average in Australia .
Australian temperatures have increased by approximately 0.9 ºC since 1910 - consistent with global warming trends .
scientific studies have linked global and Australian temperature increases to the enhanced greenhouse effect .
the early months of 2005 were also very dry over much of Australia with the January-May period being the 2nd driest on record .
Australia ' s area-averaged rainfall is calculated from a network of around 5000 rainfall stations .
observations from this network reveal that , when compared to historical records , Tasmania was the wettest State in 2005 , while Queensland and Western Australia were the driest .
over the New Year bushfires have caused havoc in many parts of Australia , with houses , farm stock devastated .
thousands of hectares of bushland and farmland have been burnt out .
environmentalists say the weather is a precursor of things to come : `` 2005 gave us a little taste of what life will be like if we fail to tackle climate change , ' ' Greenpeace ' s Catherine Fitzpatrick said .
`` The extreme heat and bushfires of New Year ' s Day 2006 showed that it is n 't going to be fun . ' '
`` If action is n 't taken soon to avoid catastrophic climate change , Australians will have John Howard to blame for failing to act when he had the chance . ' '
Ms Fitzpatrick said the Federal Government was as beholden to the coal and aluminium industries as the Japanese government was to whaling companies , and with far more devastating impacts .
`` Today ' s figures should spur our Environment Minister ... to real action -- ratify Kyoto , quit coal and move towards clean , renewable energy , ' ' Ms Fitzpatrick said .
federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell said he recognized climate change was the biggest modern-day environmental challenge .
`` I think that climate change is alarming , ' ' he said on ABC radio .
`` I regard climate change as the number one environmental challenge ... ' '
`` These figures add to the weight of evidence that climate change is real and it ' s a problem that the world needs to work together to seek to solve . ' '
Australia and the United States are the only developed nations to have refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol , which calls on countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
the Government argues Kyoto will not work because it does not commit developing nations to reducing emissions .
`` It only covers just over a third of the countries of the world and ... we need something that includes all countries of the world , ' ' said Senator Campbell .
many regions across the globe also reported an exceptionally warm year .
according to a preliminary estimate released by the World Meteorological Organization -LRB- WMO -RRB- , the global mean temperature for 2005 was about 0.48 ° C above normal , putting 2005 amongst the four warmest years globally since records commenced in 1861 .
the aftershock reached a magnitude of 5.9 with the epicenter located nineteen kilometers west of Pichilemu , according to the University of Chile Geological Survey -LRB- UCGS -RRB- .
however , the United States Geological Survey -LRB- USGS -RRB- reported that it reached a magnitude of 5.8 ; had a depth of 8,5 kilometers ; and that the epicenter was located 65 kilometers at the southwest of San Antonio , Valparaíso ; 100 kilometers at the west of Rancagua , O 'Higgins 105 kilometers at the northwest of Curicó , Maule and ; 135 kilometers at the southwest of Santiago , Metropolitan Region .
United States glam metal band Poison is suing Capitol Records and EMI Music Marketing over an alleged breach of contract .
poison claim the two companies have underpaid them royalties for years .
the band claims Capitol miscategorized various record sales and miscalculated every possible expense since the 1980s .
they say when attempting to check company records they received no co-operation and are now asking a judge to order the firms to reveal their records so the band can determine how much they are owed .
new signing Laurent Robert and the return of Greg Sutton were not enough for Toronto F.C. as they fell 4-1 to D.C. United in Washington .
early goals from Luciano Emilio and Santino Quaranta left Toronto in an uphill battle for the rest of the match .
the hill only became bigger in the 22nd minute when Kevin Harmse put in a hard challenge on Gonzalo Peralta and was subsequently sent off .
Marcelo Gallardo then made it 3-0 for the home side in the 52nd minute .
Quaranta crossed the ball and Gallardo was wide open to smash the ball into an open net .
Jaime Moreno capped off the scoring for D.C. in the 78th before Edu opened Toronto ' s MLS account with his first goal of the season .
the loss leaves Toronto at 0-2-0 on the season , while DC pick up their first win after losing their opener .
DC now travel to play Real Salt Lake , while Toronto will visit David Beckham and the L.A. Galaxy .
between the debate and the first voting round Bobošíková withdrew her candidacy , citing a lack of support for her .
Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center , Bangkok -- Wikinews interviewed Georgia Inglis , of the Australia women ' s national wheelchair basketball team , known as the Gliders .
the Gliders are in Bangkok , Thailand , for the Asia-Oceania Zone Wheelchair Basketball Championships , which are being held at the Thai-Japanese Bangkok Youth Center .
they are hoping to qualify for the World Championships , which are being held in Toronto , Canada , in June next year .
Inglis is one of two new players in the team .
Wikinews caught up with her before the Gliders ' match against China .
the United States 2008 federal deficit has reached a record high , US $ 454.8 billion -- more than double last year ' s deficit .
financial experts believe that next year , the deficit will reach over $ 700 billion , while the National Debt Clock has recently run out of digits to record over $ 10 trillion in national debt .
the deficit is now equivalent to 3.2 % of the Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- of the United States , with the government ' s total income being 17.8 % of GDP , and total outlays being equivalent to 21 % of GDP .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson blamed the deficit on the housing market , related markets , and slow growth .
he said the news would `` reinforce the need to not only address short-term challenges , but pursue policies that promote economic growth and fiscal responsibility , and address entitlement reform ' ' .
Democrats like Senator Kent Conrad , however , placed the blame on `` President Bush ' s failed policies ' ' .
`` The reality is that the next president will be inheriting a fiscal and economic mess of historic proportions , ' ' said Conrad , adding that `` it will take years to dig our way out ' ' .
another Democrat , House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt , also blamed the Bush administration .
`` The eight years of this administration will include the five biggest budget deficits in history , ' ' he said .
`` The resulting debt will be passed to our children and grandchildren . ' '
Jim Nussle , director of the Office of Management and Budget said that he believes that the deficit will start to decline .
`` The bipartisan stimulus bill and the slow economy are the primary reasons for the increase in deficit as reflected in this year ' s budget results . ' '
`` This increase reinforces the need to adopt and maintain policies that promote economic growth and fiscal responsibility , including entitlement reform and pro-growth tax policies . ' '
`` I am confident the economy can return to stronger growth with a declining deficit -- after working through current challenges if Congress limits wasteful and excessive spending . ' '
the special TADA court hearing the 1993 Mumbai blasts case began delivering its verdict today .
four members of the Memon family , Yakub , Essa , Rubina and Yusuf , were found guilty of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism and also having contacts with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim , and now face between 5 years and life in prison .
the judge decided to acquit three other Memons , Suleiman , Hanifa and Raheen , giving them the benefit of the doubt .
Yakub , younger brother of prime accused Ibrahim Mushtaq ` Tiger ' Memon , was also convicted of possessing unauthorised arms .
the rest of the accused , including Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt , will hear the judgements in their cases over a period of four weeks .
after hearing the court ' s ruling against him , Yakub lost his temper , hurling abuses at the judge and accusing him of `` making terrorists out of innocents ' ' .
after the blasts , which killed over 250 people in 13 explosions across the city , the Memon family fled to Dubai , and then Pakistan .
except Tiger and his brother Ayub , however , the rest of them returned to India in 1994 , and were arrested by the CBI .
since then , Yakub has been in custody and has , according to his lawyer Subhash Kanse , been undergoing treatment for depression .
England have beaten West Indies by five wickets in the second Twenty20 international of the West Indies tour of England at The Oval , London , England .
England ' s victory tied the two match series 1-1 after West Indies won the first Twenty20 yesterday .
Chris Gayle got the West Indies off to a good start with 61 runs off 37 balls , but the England bowlers and fielders restricted their score to 169-7 after 20 overs despite some big hits from Marlon Samuels .
in reply , England faltered , losing three wickets in 14 balls followed by the dismissal of Kevin Pietersen for 19 .
however Owais Shah scored 55 to help England past the target .
the tour now moves on to a series of three One-Day International matches starting on 1st July .
earlier in the tour , England won a four match Test series 3-0 .
London , England -- Yesterday Wikinews had the opportunity to tour the Ottobrock wheelchair repair workshops at the Paralympic Village in London .
it is one of a network of workshops at every Paralympic venue .
they are run by Ottobrock , which has been repairing wheelchairs at the Paralympics since 1988 .
the workshop opened on August 22 and will remain until September 10 .
they liken themselves to the pit crew of motor sport -- except that they have no idea what sort of equipment they will have to work with .
the store room contains 15,000 spare parts , with everything from spare carbon fiber running blades to spare tyres -- over 2,000 of them .
they stock Ottobrock parts and their competitors ' too , as they have no idea what will arrive at the workshop next .
athletes from around the world bring in all manner of equipment .
the prosthetic technicians have to deal with everything from flat tyres to broken spokes to full-scale rebuilds .
they frequently collaborate on determining how best to effect a repair .
the objective is to get the wheelchair repaired and back in service as soon as possible .
those for wheelchair basketball and rugby have cambered wheels so they can spin around .
Ottobrock has a welding workshop where frames are repaired ; the teams ' equipment managers understandably can not bring such heavy equipment with them to the games , so they rely on the workshops .
when a repair job is required , it is often required in a hurry .
at the Turkey vs United States game , a chair was repaired during the match .
in addition to wheelchairs , the workshops handle all manner of work with prostheses .
the Chinese Boccia team brought in its power chairs to have the electronics adjusted .
in that sport , having the controls working perfectly is all-important .
close to 6,500 civilians have been killed and many thousands more wounded in the past three months during heavy fighting in Sri Lanka , according to a report by the United Nations .
earlier this year , the army launched a crackdown on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam -LRB- Tamil Tigers -RRB- to oust them from their territory in the northeastern part of Sri Lanka , which the rebels have occupied for several years .
the rebels have now been forced back to a small coastal strip , where about fifty thousand people have been trapped after the area was evacuated of 100,000 people .
Thangamuttu Sathyamurthi , a government health official in the war zone , reported that people were dying of starvation , and that there was a large deficit of medicine and food .
according to the medical relief group Médecins Sans Frontières -LRB- Doctors without Borders -RRB- , many of the people who had fled the conflict zone had gunshot and blast wounds .
the government has accused the Tamil Tiger rebels of using civilians as human shields , a claim that the rebels deny .
the rebels have accused the Sri Lankan army of randomly shelling civilian areas .
the U.N. says that the rate of civilian deaths in the country has risen sharply .
on average , 33 civilians were killed per day at the end of January .
the number has now increased to an average 116 per day .
quarterback Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers broke Dan Marino ' s record for career touchdown passes on Sunday , throwing number 421 to receiver Greg Jennings with 4 : 56 left in the first quarter .
the recordbreaking pass was a 16-yard slant route , and Favre had to throw a bullet to complete it .
though the game was being played at the Metrodome , even the Minnesota Vikings fans stood and applauded as Favre celebrated with his teammates .
after the announcement of the record was made , a taped message from Marino played on the Jumbotron .
`` I ' d like to take a minute to congratulate you on breaking one of the great records in sports . ' '
`` I loved holding the touchdown record for the past 13 years , but if someone was going to break it , I ' m glad it was someone like you , who has always competed at the highest level and always played only to win , ' ' said Marino .
`` Over the past 17 years , you ' ve been a credit to the Packers , and to the National Football League and to the sport that we all love so much . ' '
this historic event came just two weeks after Favre broke John Elway ' s record for career wins by a quarterback , defeating the New York Giants for win number 149 .
the Green Bay icon also holds the records for career completions and consecutive games started by a quarterback , which continued on Sunday at 241 .
later in the second quarter of today ' s game , Favre threw the 8,359 th pass of his career , eclipsing another of Marino ' s records .
when asked about the record after the game , a subdued Favre said , `` It ' s just a number . ' '
`` I ' m more proud of the fact that we won this game ... ' '
`` I ' m pleased it ' s over , and I ' m honored . ' '
`` To play this long , I think , is a special thing and to achieve this is , uh , very special , ' ' .
he added that , in his mind , Dan Marino is still the best quarterback of all time .
ETA -LRB- Euskadi Ta Askatasuna -RRB- , a separatist group based out of the Basque region of northern Spain , announced in a recorded and written message that it would end its armed campaign for independence , instead focusing on political means for achieving its goals .
in the video sent to the BBC , ETA stated that , while the autonomy framework enshrined in the Spanish constitution is `` not the way to satisfy the wishes of the Basque people ' ' , the organization was committed to finding a democratic solution to the conflict .
several analysts have suggested that this most recent ceasefire is based on ETA ' s tactics causing their support in the Basque region to plummet .
author Paddy Woodworth found in a recent trip to the region that the group ' s actions had made former supporters of the movement believe ETA was politically finished .
the BBC ' s Sarah Rainsford said that ETA is at the weakest point in its 51-year history and that the ceasefire may just be a ploy to disguise that weakness .
the group , which is listed as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States , have declared ceasefires several times before , which have all ended in a resumption of violence .
the most recent ceasefire , in 2006 , led to peace talks between the group and the Spanish government , but they were interrupted by a car-bombing at Madrid ' s Barajas Airport .
the bombing was frowned upon by all involved in the peace process , including other Basque separatist parties in the region .
on Friday , all six major American television networks ; ABC , CBS , FOX , NBC , WB , and UPN , along with most PBS stations , united in a rare show of solidarity to air a one hour charity concert called Shelter from the Storm : a Concert for the Gulf Coast .
the concert aired live at 8pm in the Eastern time zone and 7pm in the Central time zone and on tape-delay in the Mountain and Pacific time zones .
it was also shown on the Internet and many cable networks such as USA , Bravo and G4 .
the show was produced by Joel Gallen , the same man behind the September 11th tribute concert America : a Tribute to Heroes .
the show was not censored for political statements but was for obscenities .
last week , rapper Kayne West made a remark on an NBC charity show A Concert for Hurricane Relief , in which West claimed that `` George Bush does n 't care about black people . ' ' , which caused controversy .
throughout the concert there were notable acts , such U2 performing `` One ' ' with Mary .
another moment was Garth Brooks , Trisha Yearwood and the house band from The Late Show with David Letterman doing a cover of John Fogerty ' s `` Who ' ll Stop The Rain ' ' .
donations were being solicited for the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army .
Telecom company AT & T provided toll-free calling and 10 call centers for the event and MCI provided volunteers from their call centers .
BET also held a charity concert called S.O.S -LRB- Saving OurSelves -RRB- , a half-hour before cutting to the main one .
MTV , MTV Overdrive , VH1 and CMT will air a charity show Saturday called ReAct Now : music & Relief .
Ian Alleyne , host of Trinidad TV show Crime Watch , has been charged with crimes under the Sexual Offences Act after a tape purporting to show a mentally ill teenage girl being raped was allegedly broadcast last year .
the footage allegedly was on-air thrice last October and triggered multiple complaints to police .
Caribbean Communications Network ' s -LRB- CCN ' s -RRB- channel TV6 is jointly charged under the same act as Alleyne , as well as under the Telecommunications Act .
Alleyne has been hospitalised following his arrest , owing to chest pains .
he is due to go before a magistrate , and can not receive bail until he does so .
police had visited CCN offices in Port of Spain twice last year seeking the tape .
Alleyne issued a message to The Trinidad Express criticising the decision not to grant him bail until he appears in court .
he said it `` is really a sad state of affairs on the part of the police . ' '
`` What have I done that they have seen it fit to ensure that I ' m only granted bail before a magistrate ? ' '
Mexico ' s electoral court has unanimously rejected claims of massive fraud in the July 2nd presidential election and reported that the partial recount ordered at the end of last month has not changed the original result of a narrow victory for conservative candidate Felipe Calderon of the National Action Party -LRB- PAN -RRB- .
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party -LRB- PRD -RRB- , continues to insist that the election was rigged and has vowed to continue fighting the result .
Lopez Obrador has rejected the ruling and suggested forming a rival parallel government .
there is no legal avenue to appeal the court ' s ruling , in except of the 39th article of the Mexican Constitution which states : `` The sovereignty of the state resides on the citizens . ' '
`` The citizens have always the righ to change or to modify its government ' ' , article that has been claimed by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as a right to summon a National Democratic Convention .
the seven judges have until August 31 to resolve all complaints and until September 6 to officially declare a president-elect or annul the elections .
Lopez Obrador has led massive protests in Mexico City over the past month demanding a full recount .
`` Never more will we accept that an illegal and illegitimate government is installed in our country , ' ' he told thousands of supporters following the ruling calling upon them to never accept Calderon as president and to decide if he should form a parallel government and -LRB- or -RRB- continue nationwide protests .
Leonel Castillo , the president of the tribunal , said Lopez Obrador ' s claims of massive fraud `` turned out to be completely unfounded . ' '
Lopez Obrador ' s election team had filed complaints at 50,000 polling stations but the court ordered a recount at only 11,839 stations or 9 % of all voting locations following massive street protests .
Calderon won the intial ballot count by a margion of less than 0.6 %
Australia will press on with plans to withdraw its troops from Iraq in June this year , although promises were made by the nation ' s foreign minister that relations with the United States will not be affected by the move .
foreign minister Stephen Smith said that the withdrawal will be conducted in an orderly fashion to minimize inconvenience to other nations in Iraq .
speaking in New York as part of his first US visit since the election he said `` We want to do that in a way which sees minimal disruption , which causes the least inconvenience to our allies there , both the United States and the United Kingdom . ' '
on Monday Smith will meet with Condoleezza Rice and others to discuss Afghanistan , where Australia also has troops stationed .
it is currently the intention for this to remain the case .
Smith said of the effect on relations with the US - which have been strong since World War II - `` It ' s not something which I believe will disturb what to date has been a very good working relationship between the new government and the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- administration . ' '
`` It ' s a very strong alliance - an alliance which transcends changes in governments . ' '
`` Administrations come and go , governments come and go , but the alliance is a long-term , enduring fundamental relationship between our two nations . ' '
the confirmation is important as Australia saw a new government elected in November .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd -LRB- Labor -RRB- defeated Conservative head and former PM John Howard .
Howard is a supporter of US President George W. Bush and his government .
Germany beat Argentina 4-2 on penalties to book a place in the Fifa World Cup semi-finals in Berlin , Friday .
the match had drawn 1-1 without many clear chances for either side due to defensive play on both sides .
first it was Germany who were unable to be positive as Argentina dominated play with 65 per cent of ball possession .
four minutes after half-time Roberto Ayala got across Miroslav Klose to meet Juan Riquelme ' s corner which he powered between Jens Lehmann and his near post guard , Philipp Lahm .
the goal early in the second period made for a more exciting match which had been mostly uneventful in a first half during which neither side could muster more than a single shot .
Juergen Klinsmann may be credited with a substitution change that partially helped Germany get an equalising goal .
the fast David Odonkor troubled Juan Sorin and the Argentine left flank and allowed Germany to press forward nearer to the opposition penalty area .
Argentine manager may also have made a tactical mistake and suffered form a moment of bad fortune .
in the minutes before Germany equalised from Ballack ' s wonderful left field cross his goalkeeper had to be stretchered off with a muscle injury .
Jose Pekerman followed his keeper ' s substitutions with two defensive ones ; taking off creative midfield playmaker Riquelme and forward Hernan Crespo .
the gifts of Lionel Messi and Javier Saviola were left on the bench while Julio Cruz , a long ball-holding forward , was brought on to partner Carlos Tevez .
the bad luck and changes seemed to put Germany in charge of the tactical game for the first time in the match .
a minute after Cruz arrived Pekerman might have regretted his decision .
Klose ' s fifth World Cup goal ten minutes from time put him at the top of the Fifa Golden Boot leader board as the tournament ' s highest goalscorer .
he beat his marker to dip and head beyond Leonardo Franco after Tim Borowski , a substitution on 74 minutes , had flicked on a Ballack cross .
the game finished 1-1 and the two halves of extra time mirrored the match ; first half uneventful , the second half more attacking .
Fabricio Coloccini came closest to breaking the deadlock when he hit the crossbar from 45 yards trying to catch Lehmann off his goal line .
neither Germany or Argentina had lost in a World Cup penalty contest ; both sides had won three .
all the penalties hit the target and were well struck , except Ayala ' s who hit a soft effort which Lehmann saved to his left .
Cambiasso ' s effort to Lehmann ' s left was better struck but the keeper had guessed the right side to dive to break Argentine hearts .
FIFA launched an investigation into an on-field melee which began after the penalties had been decided in Germany ' s favor .
unused Argentine substitute Leandro Cufre assaulted German Per Mertesacker and was presented the red card by Lubos Michel .
according to the German captain Michael Ballack the conflict originated when Argentine players shouted at the German team during the shootout .
when Tim Borowski got Germany ' s fourth penalty he made a sign to the Argentine players to be quiet .
after the penalty kicks Argentine players approached Borowski and a scuffle of mostly pushing began that involved dozens of players , referees , coaches and substitutes .
FIFA said television pictures would be looked at and fines or sanctions would be considered if appropriate .
Mark Webber gained his maiden Formula 1 win today at the German Grand Prix , after 130 races .
his Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel came in second , with Ferrari ' s Felipe Massa third .
Webber started from pole position , but touched Rubens Barrichello at the beginning after a slow start .

this enabled him to join back in to the race in first place .
Jenson Button remains first in the championship with 68 points , with Vettel and Webber overtaking Barrichello , taking second and third respectively .

`` The team had patience with me , everyone in Australia and a few people who doubted me too so hello to them as well . ' '

Canadian researchers from C-crest Laboratories have discovered an `` unusually high ' ' amount of bacteria in bottled water .
researchers do n 't blame specific brands , but bottled water in general .
a random study found unusually high rates of heterotrophic bacteria in the bottled water , more than 500 cfu , the legal limit set by United States Pharmacopeia on how much bacteria should be present in drinking water in Canada .
unusually high amounts of bacteria were present in 70 % of the test samples across several brands of bottled water .
`` Heterotrophic bacteria counts in some of the bottles were found to be in revolting figures of -LRB- 100 -RRB- times more than the permitted limit , ' ' said Sonish Azam , a Canadian researcher involved in the study , `` This amount of bacteria is alarming , as if we are ingesting a cup of culture . ' '
`` Microbiologically speaking , ' ' she said , `` tap water is purer than bottled water -- most bottled water .
the bacteria are not very harmful to an average person , but many sensitive groups , such as the young , sick or elderly , could get sick from it .
`` Heterotrophic bacteria counts in drinking water are not a health concern to the general public , ' ' was the concluding analyses of a recent study by the World Health Organization .
Vladimir Putin has relieved from power Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov , the head of the Russian navy .
this comes a month after an incident where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine , and had to be rescued with help from abroad .
no reason was given for Kuroyedov ' s dismissal , although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief ' s poor health .
Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000 , in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank .
Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin , who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy .
in remarks Putin made about this leadership change and referring to Masorin , he said `` The recent exercises , including those I have attended , show that the navy is developing and that is certainly your merit to a large extent . ' '
Putin also added `` at the same time , there were difficult events , tragedies , but I would like to underline once again that with all these problems , all these tragedies , the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival . ' '
Masorin added while in a hall at the Admiralty , `` One thing is clear -- to continue in the condition which we are in and do nothing is simply not possible . ' '
`` I have been given the task of stopping the navy shaking public opinion . ' '
`` I am not experiencing euphoria at being appointed head of the navy . ' '

a woman in Australia has been killed in a shark attack .
the attack occurred at 5pm -LRB- Local Time -RRB- just off Amity Point , North Stradbroke Island , south-east of Brisbane .
the woman , described as 21 , had lost both arms up to the elbow and sustained severe wounds to her torso and legs .
she was carried to shore by friends and was then flown by rescue helicopter to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane .
the woman was holidaying from Brisbane with a church camp and attempts to contact her family have been made .
emergency Services Rescue Helicopter crew officer Rod Morgan said the woman had suffered massive blood loss .
`` She was very pale ' ' he said , `` We were diverted right away and were able to be on the scene within minutes and were able to have the patient at hospital within an hour of the attack . ' '
`` She had life threatening injuries she had lost significant amounts of blood and the patient had what we would call an altered level of consciousness where it was n 't able to communicate directly with the patient ' ' said Queensland Ambulance paramedic Lachlan Parker .
there were many witnesses at the scene and they are now being interviewed by Police at Amity Point .
one witness , who asks to not be identified , described that the victim was swimming in the sea with her Border Collie .
when the attack happened , the dog ran home to raise the alarm .
`` I was across the road from where she was staying and I saw the dog come flying up the road all wet and shivering and whimpering , ' ' she said , `` Then a little boy came running up and said the girl had lost her leg and her arm and everyone ran out of the house towards the beach . ' '
`` It was just a little black-and-white dog but he was crazy so I locked him under the house . ' '
other reports claim that the woman had been scuba diving in murky shallow water approximately 15 metres from the shore .
the woman is believed to be from McDowall in Brisbane , but her name has not yet been released .
a resident of Amity Point for 20 years , Brad Ross , said tourists visiting the area have been warned of potential attacks ; `` The shore just falls away into 30m of water and there are plenty of bull sharks out there . ' '
`` People know when they enter the water there they ' re stepping into a shark habitat . ' '
other beaches on the island are protected by drum lines .
Queensland state police inspector Peter Harding believes from the severity of the woman ' s injuries that she was attacked by a group of bull sharks , a species known for aggressive behavior this time of year .
water police will search for the sharks today and as a result , beaches on the east and west of Amity Point have been closed .
this is the first attack in the area since August 1972 .
local wisdom cautions against allowing dogs in the water at swimming beaches , because of a fear that they attract sharks , perhaps because of residue accumulated from fleas which live on the dog ' s blood .

rock band Rage Against The Machine have beaten Joe McElderry to become the UK ' s official Christmas number one , following one of the biggest battles in the history of the UK Singles Chart .
their song Killing in the Name pushed the X Factor winner ' s new single The Climb into second place .
a Facebook campaign backing the American band aimed to stop an X Factor winner reaching the Christmas number one spot once again .
artists from the TV talent show , owned by music mogul Simon Cowell , have taken the festive top spot for four years in a row .
the group attracted over 900,000 members and widespread press attention , after it was started by Jon and Tracy Morter .
`` Are you getting fed up about the possibility of ANOTHER X-Factor Christmas No. 1 ? ... us too ... so we ' re going to do something about it ! , ' ' they said on the group ' s Facebook page .
they decided to back `` Killing In The Name ' ' , first released in 1992 .
Cowell had previously branded the campaign `` cynical ' ' , but on Saturday contacted the Morters to congratulate them on making a `` very exciting race for the Christmas number one ' ' .
the campaign has also raised over # 69,000 for homeless charity Shelter .
rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello had backed the campaign on Twitter .

the result was announced on BBC Radio 1 ' s chart show this evening by Scott Mills .
McElderry had been due to appear on the show , but did not arrive .
the latest advertisement for United States Republican presidential candidate John McCain is questioning Democrat Barack Obama ' s benefit to families .
last week the BBC reported that the McCain campaign had released an advertisement comparing Obama to American celebrities Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , calling him `` the biggest celebrity in the world . ' '
McCain ' s newest advertisement , released early this week , continues along those same lines .
`` Is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family ? ' ' the narrator asks , according to The Boston Globe and a video of the ad displayed on its website .
with images of wind turbines in the background , the narrator says , `` Renewable energy to transform our economy , create jobs and energy independence , that ' s John McCain . ' '
the Boston Globe reports that McCain ' s latest ad does not acknowledge that Obama ' s economic policy , especially the proposed rollback of current president George W. Bush ' s capital gains tax cuts , would largely affect the wealthiest of America , not the middle class .
Obama , the BBC reports , is quoted as calling McCain `` cynical , ' ' `` desperate ' ' and `` in the pocket of Big Oil . ' '
the latest Obama video , shown on the USA Today website , touts McCain as `` just more of the same ' ' politics employed by George W. Bush .
the ad cites a May 22 , 2003 Fox News Channel interview where McCain says `` the President and I agree on most issues . ' '
`` There was a recent study that showed I voted with the President over 90 percent of the time . ' '
the ad then criticizes McCain ' s policies on tax cuts , money for oil companies , and `` tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas . ' '
McCain is set to appear at an Ohio furniture plant Wednesday to reinforce the messages in his latest advertisement .
`` America has the second highest business tax rate in the entire world , ' ' he plans to say , according to prepared remarks issued by his campaign , and released by The Boston Globe .
`` Is it any wonder that jobs are moving overseas when we are taxing them out of the country ? ' '
`` Unfortunately Senator Obama ' s plans would raise taxes on businesses even more . ' '
`` He has promised tax increases on income , tax increases on investment , tax increases on small businesses . ' '
`` Raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs . ' '
`` Is the biggest proponent of George Bush ' s tired , failed policies ready to bring about change ? ' '
`` Another day brings another dishonest attack from John McCain . ' '
`` While Senator McCain knows that Senator Obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 % of American families , what he ' s not telling us is that he wants to give $ 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies , continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas , and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class families . ' '
`` It ' s time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to America . ' '

a police officer has been killed in County Armagh , Northern Ireland by Continuity IRA gunmen a mere 48 hours after two soldiers were killed .
in what is presumed to be an attempt by dissident Republicans to derail the peace process , Pc Stephen Carroll was shot in the head just before 10 : 00 p.m. on March 9 .

Medha Patkar , Narmada Bachao Andolan activist in the ninth day of a hunger strike protesting the Sardar Sarovar Project , is forcibly moved to hospital in New Delhi by police .
on the ninth day of the hunger strike she and two other activists had undertaken to protest the Indian government ' s decision to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam across the Narmada river and the lack of progress in rehabilitating people displaced by the dam project .
Patkar was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where she was placed under intensive care .
doctors have said that she is conscious and her condition is stable .
police sources say that Patkar has not been arrested as of now , but an First Information Report has been lodged against her for attempting to commit suicide .
activists of the Narmada Bachao Andolan tried to prevent the police from moving Patkar and some were arrested on rioting charges .
over 100 Australian Jews , including two authors and a federal minister , have condemned Israel ' s invasion of the Gaza Strip .
the 113 signatories are members of a group known as Independent Australian Jewish Voices -LRB- IAJV -RRB- .
Antony Loewenstein , the groups founder , told The Age that he expected outrage from the loudest Jewish voices .
but the IAJV had found a sizeable minority of Australian Jews who valued an independent perspective as opposed to the blindly pro-Israel position .
`` However , since Palestinians have no means of self-defence against the most powerful military force in the Middle East . ' '
`` We particularly call on Israel to end its brutal assault on the vulnerable Palestinian people of Gaza and to reconsider its rejection of the United Nations Security Council ' s call for a ceasefire , ' ' the statement said .
`` History has demonstrated that military punishment has never broken the spirit of a people or produced peace , ' ' added the statement .
`` It would only inflame hatred of Jews and of Israel , while doing nothing to protect the lives of Israelis . ' '
`` Above all , it would undermine attempts to work with peace-seeking Palestinians for a lasting , just solution . ' '
Colin Rubenstein , executive director of the Australia / Israel and Jewish Affairs Council , said the statement was up to Mr Loewenstein ' s `` usual form -- totally wrong on every fact , totally unbalanced , and totally insensitive to Israeli suffering ' ' .
`` They propose that the population of southern Israel must continue to live under constant rocket bombardment , opposing all practical efforts to actually invoke the right to self-defence the signatories say they recognize , ' ' he said .
some flu viruses in the United States and Canada have shown increased levels of resistance to the antiviral drug Tamiflu -LRB- oseltamivir -RRB- , the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said on Friday .
Tamiflu is currently the recommended treatment for humans infected with bird flu , and governments worldwide have been stockpiling the drug in case of a flu pandemic .
the drug resistance appears to be limited to the H1N1 variant which causes seasonal flu , while H3N2 or influenza B strains and the H5N1 strain that causes bird flu did not show increased resistance .
while previous studies showed resistance levels below 1 % , samples tested by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now showed around 5 % resistance , and in a Canadian survey of 81 samples , 8 showed resistance .
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control found 19 cases of resistance among 148 samples from last November .
in a wider study of 437 H1N1 isolates from 19 countries , the European agency found 59 resistant samples from 9 countries .
resistance has not been shown to increase in Japan or Hong Kong .
the WHO is now contacting national authorities to get more data on flu resistance .
these viruses have acquired a mutation that makes them resistant , and the WHO statement said that a resistant strain has probably emerged spontaneously .
the statement added that these mutations would most likely render Tamiflu ineffective for the prevention or treatment of flu caused by resistant H1N1 viruses .
the WHO also stated that this phenomenon does not influence the effectiveness of flu immunizations .
resistant strains have shown no evidence of causing more severe disease or being more easily transmissible .
the Labor Party ' s 2005 election manifesto read `` We are committed to retaining the independent nuclear deterrent ' ' .
although there have been reports that planning and design work on replacement vessels and new designs of nuclear war heads has been proceeding for some years , the first Cabinet meeting to consider this pledge will take place tomorrow .
no Cabinet papers have been circulated before the meeting at which it is said there will be a `` first run round the issues ' ' .
a further Cabinet meeting is to be held prior to the publication of a White Paper just before Christmas .
the principle of retaining a nuclear deterrent will be put to the vote in the House of Commons next year and , although it may split the Labor Party , is likely to be carried with the support of the Conservative opposition .
it is reported that some Cabinet Ministers have reservations about the prudence of maintaining the nuclear deterrent when the apparent threats are from saboteurs and suicide bombers .
they also have doubts about the legality of adding to the stock of nuclear warheads contrary to the spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and about the way that the decision is being pushed through without consultation with the Labor Party .
among those with doubts are the Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett , Hilary Benn , Minister of State for International Development , and Peter Hain , Secretary of State for Wales and Northern Ireland .
the only other European country with nuclear capability is France .
Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Brown are agreed on the need to retain a nuclear deterrent .
their reasons include keeping the country ' s seat at the top table of international politics .
the Trident missile system is carried in four nuclear-powered Vanguard class submarines , the first of which was commissioned in August 1993 .
the current Trident system cost # 12.6 Bn to introduce at 1996 prices , and requires # 280m a year to maintain .
replacements for the smaller nuclear-powered w : attack submarines are under construction and will be armed with Tomahawk missile tactical missile systems .
the atomic weapons establishment at Aldermaston is reported to be developing tactical nuclear weapons , smaller and of shorter range than Trident suitable for firing using the same type of launcher as Tomahawks .
the United States House of Representatives has passed the bipartisan US $ 152 billion economic stimulus package that gives one-time rebates to United States citizens , US $ 600 for individuals or US $ 1,200 for couples plus US $ 300 for each child .
US $ 300 checks would be sent to people on low-income including retirees on Social Security which was not included in the original bill backed by President George W. Bush .
the plan would begin to decrease rebates for citizens with taxable incomes of US $ 75,000 for individuals and US $ 150,000 for couples .
the checks would go out to more than a 130 million Americans according to Treasury secretary Henry Paulson .
the House overwhelmingly approved the more broad Senate amended bill which included the low-income portion mentioned above along with provisions that would keep illegal aliens from receiving a rebate check .
despite some opposition from some Congressmen , such as John B. T. Campbell III of California ' s 48th congressional district , the plan passed overwhelmingly 380 -- 34 .
Campbell called the plan `` wealth redistribution ' ' and noted it did not have safeguards to prevent illegals from receiving these rebates and also claimed that stimulus plan would increase the deficit more and noted the cause of the looming recession was because of `` credit problems . ' '
the United States Senate voted hours earlier on the bill which passed in the Senate , 81 -- 16 . after having to shed some incentives included by Senate Democrats which caused the bill to fail .
some of the incentives that were left out of the plan in a compromise to gain Republican support were demands for benefits for long-term unemployed workers and stipulation that would allow low-income citizens to pay off heating bills and let home builders pay off losses off the current year against previous tax years .
President Bush approved of the package , noting in a statement , `` This plan is robust , broad-based , timely , and it will be effective , this bill will help to stimulate consumer spending and accelerate needed business investment . ' '
his convictions include assaulting his fourth wife in 2006 , and he served four months despite requesting community service ; a stab attack from behind with a five-inch blade on a friend landed him a two-year suspended sentence and put the man in hospital .
he also served thirteen months for stabbing a friend while drinking and has been prosecuted for attacking a man with a knife in a restaurant , a case dropped through lack of evidence .
according to a spokesman for NATO , an attempted hijacking of a Norwegian tanker in the Gulf of Aden by Somali pirates has been thwarted by NATO forces .
the MV Front Ardennes came under attack by pirates in a small skiff at about 6 : 00 PM on Saturday .
helicopters and a warship were dispatched to rescue the vessel , and the pirates were apprehended seven hours after the initial hijacking .
officials said that pirates tried to flee in the dark , but were caught by a Canadian vessel .
seven of the pirate gunmen were temporarily detained , but were later released .
NATO spokesman Lieutenant Commander Alexandre Santos Fernandes stated that since there was no Canadian law that could have prosecuted the pirates , they had to be released .
piracy is rife off the eastern coast of Africa ; on Saturday , Somali pirates seized a Belgian ship , the Pompei , with its ten crew members , as it was headed south for the Seychelles islands .
over sixty ships , in total have been hijacked by pirates since the start of last year .
currently , pirates are thought to be holding about three hundred crew members from seventeen ships .
an on duty superintendent in the New South Wales Police Force was caught speeding in an unmarked police car at 176km / h in a 100km / h zone on the Olympic Highway near Junee , New South Wales on October 13 .
Superintendent Frank Goodyer , who was caught by his own officers in the Wagga Wagga Local Area Command , was charged with driving at more than 45km / h over the speed limit , had his automatically license suspended for six months and fined A $ 1674 .
it was reported by Sydney radio station 2GB that it was Superintendent Frank Goodyer as the officer who was caught speeding by his own officers after the New South Wales Police released a media release which did not name the officer who was caught .
Superintendent Frank Goodyer told ABC Radio , `` I accepted the penalty . ' '
`` I accept that I ' ve done the wrong thing and , as I say , it is still my job as a senior police officer to encourage safe driving and I will continue to do that regardless of my actions ' ' .
the European Commission -LRB- EC -RRB- has approved yesterday a takeover of loss-making UK airline bmi from Lufthansa by International Airlines Group -LRB- IAG -RRB- , owner of British Airways -LRB- BA -RRB- .
IAG will have to make concessions after told the EC the deal would be anti-competitive .
the deal is set to cost IAG , who also own Iberia , # 172.5 million .
that value could fall as budget subsidiary may be retained by Lufthansa or sold elsewhere , and IAG are reported to be primarily interested in the main bmi business .
IAG intends to use acquired slots at the busy , which serves London , to expand their own routes into Asia .
the EC required IAG to surrender a number of flight slots at the airport .
the slots surrendered or made available for lease are for use to destinations in Scotland , France , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Russia .
the EC also insisted that combined BA / bmi routing be made available for competitors to buy transfer seats upon .
Lufthansa intended to shut down bmi had the bid failed .
IAG boss called the sale `` great news for Britain ' ' with results that are `` good for UK business and UK consumers . ' '
Virgin boss had previously said the move would give BA excessive dominance on Scottish flights .
more Heathrow slots earmarked for Scotland have been given up than any other destination .
Ryanair took the opportunity to claim only their own takeover bid for Aer Lingus has been a major EC casualty .
`` Today ' s rubber-stamping of BA ' s purchase of bmi shows yet again that the EC has one rule for Europe ' s flag-carriers , but different rules for Ryanair ' ' , said Ryanair chief .
nine people have died in bush-fires in the region of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia .
the fire has spread over 40,000 hectares of scrub , bushland and farmland so far and is still burning out of control .
hundreds of firemen have been fighting the fire , but conditions have been difficult because of strong winds and temperatures soaring well over 40 degrees Celsius .
of the nine who have died , eight were attempting to escape the advancing fire in their cars .
locals of some rural towns fled to the ocean to escape the fires .
thousands of sheep and cattle have also been killed in the fires .
separate fires have also been burning around Mount Osmond and Cleland National Park in the Adelaide hills .
bush-fires are annual occurrences in Australia , but these fires have been the worst in terms of deaths since the Ash Wednesday fires that killed 28 people in South Australia .
two years ago , over 400 houses were burnt down in a bush fire in the Australian capital city , Canberra .
today , Nintendo revealed that the real name for the console previously known by the codename `` Revolution ' ' , is Wii .

the name also sounds similar to `` yes ' ' in French and `` good ' ' in Japanese .
Australian Prime Minister John Howard has attacked US presidential candidate Barack Obama on his pledge to introduce a bill that would withdraw American troops from Iraq by March 2008 .
on Sunday , Prime Minister Howard said the move would hand victory to insurgents in Iraq .
`` I think that would just encourage those who wanted completely to destabilise and destroy Iraq , and create chaos and victory for the terrorists to hang on and hope for -LRB- an -RRB- Obama victory , ' ' Mr Howard said .
`` If I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq , I would put a circle around March 2008 , and pray , as many times as possible , for a victory not only for Obama , but also for the Democrats . ' '
Mr Obama dismissed Howard ' s comments as `` empty rhetoric ' ' , unless he was to send another 20,000 Australians to fight in Iraq .
`` So , if he ' s -LRB- inaudible -RRB- if to fight the good fight in Iraq , I would suggest that he calls up another 20,000 Australians and sends them to Iraq . ' '
`` I would also note that we have close to 140,000 troops on the ground now , and my understanding is that Mr Howard has deployed 1,400 ' ' , said Mr Obama .
the Australian government said its contribution to the war in Iraq was appropriate given Australia ' s population and military size and that Obama ' s response failed to address the `` substance of the issue ' ' .
foreign Minister Alexander Downer said 20,000 troops would be `` half of our army ' ' .
Mr Howard , considered a close ally of the United States government , has faced attacks and support from US politicians .
Democrat Terry McAuliffe said `` Firstly , the Prime Minister has been a great friend of George Bush ' s . ' '
`` He has been with him lock-step from day one on this war in Iraq . ' '
Republican presidential candidate Duncan Hunter said Howard had earned a right to comment about Obama ' s policy `` I think the Aussies have earned a right to comment on the world stage about their partner in this endeavor , because they ' ve been fighting side-by-side with us in Iraq , ' ' said Hunter .
`` And so I think that John Howard , while it was n 't a very complimentary statement , he is basically stating the truth and that is that what we say on the Senate floor on or the House floor goes to a world audience . ' '
`` And it has an impact on not only our allies , but also our adversaries . ' '
Roy Ryden , another US Democrat said Mr Howard ' s comment was `` bizarre ' ' and accused the Prime minister of interfering with US politics `` The most charitable thing you can say ab `` out Mr Howard ' s comment is bizarre .
`` You know , we ' ll make our own judgements in this country with respect to elections and Barack Obama is a terrific public servant . ' '
Mr Howard has drawn criticism from some conservative Republicans with John Cornyn saying Howard should stay out of US domestic politics .
the Australian Prime Minster further defended his statement today , claiming Obama ' s plan threatened Australia ' s national security .
`` If the United States were to withdraw her combat units from Iraq by the early part of next year it could only be represented as a defeat for the United States in Iraq , ' ' he said .
`` I hold the strongest possible view that it is contrary to the security interests of this country for America to be defeated in Iraq . ' '
Australia ' s strong links to the United States and its support for the U.S.-led war on Iraq were key issues for Howard ' s fourth straight election win in late 2004 .
the Australian opposition has used the comments as an opportunity to attack the government .
opposition leader Kevin Rudd said Howard needed to avoid taking sides in American politics as it was important for the Australia-U.S. alliance that leaders could deal with each other despite their political affiliations .
an estimated over 100,000 people protested in Tahrir Square yesterday in opposition to a constitutional decree made by Egypt ' s President Mohamed Morsi .
riot police dispersed the crowd with tear gas as clashes began .
the constitutional decree made November 22 by Morsi protected the constitution drafting body of Egypt from dissolution and also protected executive decisions from being overturned .
the decree has sparked protests and strikes reminiscent of protests which eventually toppled the then president Hosni Mubarak .
earlier this year in September Egyptian courts ruled to dissolve Egypt ' s parliament .
Morsi opposed the ruling , threatening action , but later respected the decision .
Mohamed ElBaradei said Morsi is acting like a `` new ' ' .
ElBaradei has also said that because of the recent decree `` a civil war threatens to erupt in Egypt . ' '
counter demonstration planned by the Muslim Brotherhood and Nour Party has been canceled to avoid possible further violence .
honey-bee decline has accelerated in North America beyond the steady attrition of the past 25 years according to scientists and farmers .
a relatively new term - `` Colony Collapse Disorder ' ' is being used to describe this poorly understood phenomenon .
colony Collapse Disorder -LRB- or CCD -RRB- is a syndrome evidenced by massive die-off affecting an entire insect population .
the cause of the syndrome is not yet well understood .
CCD may be caused by mites or associated diseases or unknown pathogens .
CCD is possibly linked to pesticide use though several studies have found no common environmental factors between unrelated outbreaks studied .
according to Dennis vanEngelsdorp , a bee specialist with the Pennsylvania State Department of Agriculture , `` We are pretty sure , but not certain , that it is a contagious disease . ' '
honey-bees are responsible for approximately one third of the United States crop pollination including such species as : peaches , soybeans , apples , pears , pumpkins , cucumbers , cherries , raspberries , blackberries and strawberries .
from 1971 to 2006 , approximately one half of the U.S. honey-bee colonies vanished .
the rate of attrition reached new proportions in the year 2006 , which were alarming to many farmers and honey-bee scientists .
at least eleven different states as well as portions of Canada are known to have been affected by colony collapse disorder .
the disorder has been identified in a geographically diverse group of states including Georgia , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin and California .
in some states the loss of honey-bee colonies is estimated as high as 75 percent of the population .
the phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as almond growing in California , where honey-bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value is $ US 1.5 billion .
total U.S. crops that are wholly dependent on the honey-bee are known to exceed $ US 15 billion .
in a related development on January 17 , 2007 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has drastically tightened use rules on some of the chief pesticides used on apples , blueberries , grapes , peaches , pears and other fruits pollenized by honey-bees .
citing general environmental protection and farmworker safety , the EPA recently announced the tightening of use or phaseout of the highly toxic pesticides phosmet and Azinphos methyl .
under these rule changes the use of these organophosphate pesticide would be allowed continued use for five years but have somewhat reduced dosage limits .
Azinphos methyl is a dangerous neurotoxin derived from nerve agents used during World War II .
South Korea has lost contact with its Naro-1 rocket , just 137 seconds after take-off .
Korea Aerospace Research Institute -LRB- KARI -RRB- and Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center had hoped to use a Naro-1 , South Korea ' s first carrier rocket , to launch a STSAT-2B satellite .
South Korea had postponed the launch on Wednesday due to problems with the rocket ' s fire extinguisher system .
science Ministry spokesman Pyun Kyung-bum said , `` We expect that it will be difficult to launch today ' ' .
the rocket lifted off from Goheung ' s Naro Space Centre at 1701 -LRB- 0801 GMT -RRB- today .
the rocket apparently exploded 137 seconds after launch , when a flash was seen from an on-board camera and communication was lost .
the loss of communication occurred when the rocket had achieved an altitude of around 70 kilometers -LRB- 43 mi -RRB- .
television cameras captured a white speck , presumably part of the rocket , falling into the sea .
analysts say the failure is a setback for South Korea .
if it had been successful , it would have been the first Naro-1 launch to reach orbit .
the launch cost South Korea an estimated US $ 400 million , and if successful , would have launched a satellite called the STSAT-2B into orbit .
the satellite was designed to examine climate change and its effects .
the incident is seen as a major setback for South Korea ' s space program , which had been aiming to become the 10th country to achieve the capability to launch satellites , and the fourth Asian country , after China , Japan , and India .
a successful launch would have helped South Korea to become a player in commercial space launches , an industry valued at around US $ 250 billion .
since 1992 , South Korea has launched 11 satellites from overseas sites with foreign-made rockets .
a strong earthquake struck off the southern tip of Taiwan at 12 : 26 UTC , triggering a warning from Japan ' s Meteorological Agency that a 3.3 foot tsunami could be heading towards Basco , in the Philippines .
the head of the earthquake monitoring agency in the Philippines disputed the Japanese agency ' s warnings , however .
conflicting reports have placed the magnitude of the quake between 6.7 and 7.2 on the Richter Scale , with the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau marking it at 6.7 , the United States Geological Survey estimating it at 7.1 , and the Japan Meteorological Agency putting the magnitude at 7.2 .
despite the Japanese Meteorological Agency ' s warning of a tsunami threat to the Philippines , Renato Solidum , the director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology , denied that a tsunami is headed towards the Philippines , saying that the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii had not released any tsunami advisory .
nevertheless , Solidum said that residents in low-lying areas in the Philippines should , as a precaution , move to higher ground .
in the aftermath of the quake , news agencies have aired reports of collapsed houses , hotel guests being trapped in elevators , and telephone outages due to severed lines across Taiwan .
the earthquake has damaged six submarine fiber-optic communications cables , restricting internet access to millions of users in Asia and Australia .
home users are experiencing severe connection issues , with timeouts becoming very common .
the Internet Storm Center is reporting a 100 % packet loss on certain routers .
a sample ping test from Singapore to Wikinews came up with a 380 millisecond average round trip at 50 % packet loss .
the financial markets are facing an even more alarming situation , with financial news and stock quotes from the U.S. and Europe not being able to reach Asian markets .
repairing the lines `` is not a matter of days , ' ' says Hong Seoung-Yong , a ministry official from South Korea handling the problem .
Taiwan ' s internet capacity has dropped to 40 % , and consequently the networks there are jammed .
service providers may choose to bypass those lines in favor of European ones , say a spokesman for Japanese telecoms firm KDDI Corp , Satoru Ito .
the quake took place exactly two years from the day that the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake struck , devastating Southeast Asia .
that 2004 earthquake registered as a magnitude 9.1 , and caused a tsunami with waves reaching as high as 33 feet .
Peruvians living near the site of a release of mercury are preparing to sue a U.S. mining company , announcing last Saturday that they will bring their case before a Denver judge .
on June 2 , 2000 , a serious accident in the province of Cajamarca , in Peru , poisoned many residents with mercury , a highly toxic heavy metal .
a truck from Newmont Mining Company dumped two metal canisters of mercury along an Andean highway , in the communities of San Juan , Choropampa , and Magdalena .
curious townspeople -LRB- mostly children -RRB- picked up the silvery droplets , and some even drank some of it .
some of those who came in contact with the mercury suffered blindness , and one even had a purplish rash on her body .
over 300 people directly suffered the effects of mercury poisoning .
as the owners of the Yanacocha mine which produced the mercury , Newmont Mining offered up to US $ 6 thousand to more than 700 local residents , but over 1,100 others are still engaged in a legal battle with Newmont over the case .
in today ' s global economy , many international businesses have looked overseas to maintain their profits , but environmental law professor James Otto is asking about the cost to the environment and public health .
`` Any company that wants to mine internationally now must not only have the legal right to mine but also a ` social license ' to operate , ' ' he said .
as the Peruvian residents gear up for their lawsuit against Denver-based Newmont Mining , the world ' s largest gold mining firm , some of these important questions may finally be answered .
after the breakdown of mediation talks with Newmont on January 20 , the residents and their lawyer decided to stop negotiating behind closed doors and take their case to the public .
last Saturday , March 5 , 2005 , they announced that they are bringing their suit before Denver District Judge Robert Hyatt .
this is not the first time Newmont Mining has had trouble with an emerging Third World environmental movement .
