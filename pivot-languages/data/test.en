recently , in August 2004 , a US $ 543 million lawsuit was filed against Newmont Mining by the Indonesian Environmental Ministry and local villagers .
they claim that pollution caused by the company ' s mining activities has caused serious illnesses and other health problems , including skin disease , tumors , birth defects , and a decline in fish stocks , a staple food .
one particular mining practice used frequently by Newmont Mining in Indonesia is submarine tailings disposal , a waste disposal method for mercury and arsenic that is outlawed in the United States .
at least six Newmont Mining managers , including an American and an Australian , face up to 15 years in a Jakarta prison for environmental and corporate crime in that case .
the local Peruvian residents are continuing their fight for safer mining practices and compensation for existing damage and injuries .
thousands of local townspeople protested against the Yanacocha mine last fall , demanding protection for the local water supply .
Newmont Mining officials have blamed the June 2000 mercury spill on a contractor , and have lost the battle to keep the case out of the American court system .
the Somalian government called on Saturday for the international community to help stem the wave of recent seafaring pirate attacks off their coast in the Indian Ocean .
the London-based International Maritime Bureau -LRB- IMB -RRB- reported yesterday that a Thai merchant vessel and its crew of 26 have been hijacked by Somalian pirates off their coastline .
the predominantly Thai crew were kidnapped at gunpoint , and a ransom has been demanded for their release .
the merchant ship was en-route from Brazil to Yemen with a cargo of sugar .
a letter to Somalia from the United Nations security council admonished the government .
Somalia has largely disintegrated into fiefdoms since the former dictator Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 .
last weekend , a U.S.-owned cruise ship was attacked with rocket propelled grenades .
it is the fourth ship to be attacked in the space of a week .
according to the IMB , there have been 23 other pirating attacks in coastal waters off the east African nation since March 15 .
the Obama Administration has denied Colombian journalist Hollman Morris entry into the United States , citing violation of the `` terrorist activities ' ' section of the USA ' s Patriot Act .
Morris was attempting to obtain a visa to attend Harvard University ' s Nieman Program , which is a fellowship for journalists .
the journalist has called attention to ties between outgoing Colombian president Alvaro Uribe , and right-wing militia groups in the war-plagued South American country .
human rights activists have speculated that Uribe might have influenced the visa denial .
Morris ' phone has also been tapped by the DAS , the Colombian state security agency , which is Colombia ' s CIA counterpart .
though the exact reason for Morris ' visa denial is unclear , when Morris went on-site to cover the release of four Colombian security force members ' release by FARC rebels , Uribe called the journalist `` an accomplice of terrorism ' ' .
at least 11 new species of life have been discovered in the rainforests of Thua Thien-Hue Province in Vietnam in a region of the forest described as the `` Green Corridor . ' '
the discovery was made by researchers from the World Wide Fund for Nature -LRB- WWF -RRB- .
among the new species are five orchids and at least three other species of plants , two butterflies and a snake .
at least ten more species of plants are believed to be new species but are still being studied .
`` You only discover so many new species in very special places , and the Green Corridor is one of them . ' '
`` Several large mammal species were discovered in the 1990s in the same forests , which means that these latest discoveries could be just the tip of the iceberg , ' ' said a technical adviser in Vietnam for the WWF , Chris Dickinson .
the new species of life are exclusive to the rainforest in Thua Thien-Hue Province .
the new snake , which can grow to 80 centimeters long , has been given the name white-lipped keelback because of a yellow-white stripe on the top of its head and makes its home near small streams and feeds on small animals and frogs .
the new species of butterflies are one subfamily of the Satyrinae species and the other a species of the Skipper butterfly .
the orchids , all of which are considered very rare because they were found to have no leaves whatsoever on the plant , grow in `` matter ' ' that is rotting and also contain no chlorophyll .
the other two new plant species are of Arum and Aspidistra .
the WWF is concerned that civilization may move closer into the rainforest , destroying the homes of these new species , but the government of Thua Thien-Hue Province says it ' s dedicated to making sure that they are protected , along with the rainforest .
`` The area is extremely important for conservation and the province wants to protect the forests and their environmental services , as well as contribute to sustainable development , ' ' said Provincial Forest Protection Department Director for the province , Hoang Ngoc Khanh .
the species were found in the rainforest in 2005 and 2006 .
hurricane Paloma , which the U.S. National Hurricane Center yesterday labeled as `` extremely dangerous ' ' , has recently hit Cuba .
in preparation of this , at 1500 UTC yesterday , the Cuban provinces of Granma and Holguin were issued with a Hurricane warning by the country ' s government .
due to updated forecasts , it has also removed the waning for the province of Sancti Spiritus .
220,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas in the Camaguey province , while 170,000 were evacuated from the province of Las Tunas .
the Hurricane is now weakening , however , with the NOAA stating that `` continued weakening is expected over the next day or two , even after Paloma moves off the coast of Cuba . ' '
the NOAA has also stated that `` Paloma is expected to produce additional rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches over eastern Cuba . ' '
`` Rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches are possible over the central Bahamas . ' '
hurricane Paloma was the seventeenth tropical depression of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season .
Paloma developed out of a strong tropical disturbance off the northern coast of Honduras on November 5 .
the depression then became a tropical storm then a hurricane .
the men ' s team final in artistic gymnastics reached a tense conclusion last night at the Olympic Games in London .
Japan took silver with 271.952 points , and Great Britain got bronze with 271.711 points .
Britain initially looked likely to win silver following a fall from the pommel horse by Japanese gymnast Kōhei Uchimura .

the city hall building in Buffalo , New York was evacuated after fire alarms were activated .
`` Smoke detectors went off on the 13th and 27th floors . ' '
`` Among other things we lost all communications out of the building . ' '
`` Something cut off communications , something set off those alarms and cut power to elevators , ' ' said Mike Lombardo , Buffalo ' s fire commissioner .
police and fire crews arrived on scene to discover a power surge in the 27th floor knocked out all communications between the police and fire departments in the city for nearly two hours .
fire crews had to use emergency stairways to examine the building for fire and evacuees of the 32-story building had to use emergency stairways to evacuate because elevators in the building were not functioning properly .

large herd animals may have the ability to detect earth ' s magnetic field , concluded scientists in Germany in a report published in this week ' s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences after performing studies of cattle and deer grazing and sleeping patterns .
the animals tended to face north-south oriented toward the earth ' s magnetic poles .
Hynek Burda of the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany led the team that announced the unconfirmed study .
Burda and his team gathered cattle data via analysis of Google Earth images .
the team originally intended to test for possible human magnetic field detection by studying the orientation of sleeping bags in outdoor campers , but it proved difficult to obtain data because humans usually slept under tents .
cattle were easier to observe , and 8,510 head of cattle at 308 locations demonstrated a strong tendency to align body orientation in accordance with the earth ' s magnetic field .
other possible factors such as wind or sunlight direction did not supply a better explanation for the behavior .
to compare against a second large species , Burda and his team analyzed data on 2,974 deer studied through photography , direct observation , and snow imprints .
`` I think the really amazing thing is that hunters and herdsmen and farmers did n 't notice it , ' ' said Burda according to a National Public Radio report .
Peter August of the University of Rhode Island in Kingston , commented : `` I was really amazed at the consistency with which they found north-facing cows and deer . ' '
no independent study has yet confirmed the Duisburg-Essen team ' s findings .
this is the first study that indicates magnetic field detection in large mammals .
Burda ' s previous research involves naked mole rats , a small blind mammal species whose behavior indicates an internal magnetic compass .
according to a report by Jeremy Hsu at MSNBC , `` Previous research has shown that animals such as birds , turtles and salmon migrate using a sense of magnetic direction , and small mammals such as rodents and one bat species also have a magnetic compass . ' '
a Europe-wide student movement , started in the Austrian capital of Vienna , is developing .
it started on 28 October 2009 and met with the discussions following the Conference of the Ministers for Education and Cultural Affairs in Germany on 15 October .
for Tuesday 17 November -- the 70th anniversary of the international students ' day -- a nationwide education strike in Germany has been announced .
speakers of the actions said , students are complaining that universities are underfunded and understaffed .
the students ' protest concerns the Bologna reforms and the tuition fees .
on Wednesday , 11 November some 600 students at the Free University of Berlin had occupied the largest auditorium of the central building of the humanities in the suburb of Dahlem .
afterwards actions took place in Tübingen , Munich and Basel , each with hundreds of participants .
the Potthoff building , a lecture hall of the Dresden TU has been occupied since Monday , 9 November .
actions also took place in Utrecht , Turin , Rome , Lublin , London and Birmingham .
two men have been charged with starting the Zaca Fire , the second-largest wildfire in the history of California .
the fire is continuing to burn through the Los Padres National Forest , and has consumed a total of 240,000 acres , having started on July 4 .
however , the fire is now under control , and is expected to be contained by September 4 .
Jose Jesus Cabrera of Santa Ynez , 38 , Santiago Iniguez Cervantes of Santa Maria , 46 , and the company of Rancho La Laguna , whom they worked for , have all been charged with six counts of felony in relation to starting the fire .
three of the charges are for `` recklessly causing a fire that caused great bodily injury ' ' .
two counts of this stem from the crash of a helicopter that was fighting the fires , and the other from a separate incident when a third firefighter was seriously wounded while battling the flames .
the other three counts are for recklessly causing a structure or forest fire , carelessness with a flaming substance and for not having the required permit to operate equipment capable of starting a fire .
the fire started when equipment being used on a blocked water line sparked .
58 firefighters were injured in total by the blaze , although no life-threatening injuries were sustained .
currently , 1,800 people are involved in firefighting efforts , which have cost a total of $ 114 million .
a lawyer for the men said he felt the charges were excessive considering the circumstances .
`` We have a couple of hard working guys who go out to take care of a water pipe or some cattle on a very hot day on the Fourth of July and they took precautions and despite the precautions an accident happened and a fire started , ' ' said Attorney Robert Sanger .
if convicted , the men could face up to nine years imprisonment .
there is also the possibility of fines and action to recover the costs of the fire .

al-Qaeda said in a web statement Thursday that it has killed Egypt ' s top envoy in Iraq , Ihab al-Sherif .
the Islamic terror group released a video showing a blindfolded al-Sherif identifying himself , but did not show his death .
Egypt ' s President Hosni Mubarak confirmed these reports , but did not say how the government had validated Al-Qaeda ' s claims .
Mr Al-Sherif , 51 , had been serving in Baghdad as chief envoy since early June ; he was abducted on 03 July while out buying a newspaper , eyewitnesses said .
he was not accompanied by any security at that time .
after a year of turbulent weather in Mexico and destruction of their habitat , the Monarch butterfly -LRB- Danaus plexippus -RRB- population could be down by as much as 50 % to 60 % this year , experts say .
a gathering area for the butterflies northwest of Mexico City was affected particularly hard by severe weather this winter , which killed 50 people in the region .
according to Lincoln Brower , a monarch expert with Sweet Briar College in Virginia , `` things are in pretty bad shape . ' '
the southbound migration was already the smallest in recorded history , and with the destructive winter , over half of the species ' population might have been killed .
`` This means the numbers going to Texas are going to be down ' ' , said Chip Taylor , a professor of entomology at the University of Kansas-Lawrence .
he believes it could take years for the Monarchs to repopulate .
Taylor also said that `` We ' re talking about significant degradation at overwintering sites ; the loss of habitat in the United States and Canada and climate change in Mexico . ' '
`` We ' ve had three major killing winter storms in the last decade that have never been seen previously . ' '
`` We ' re dealing with something new here , and that ' s consistent with climate change . ' '
illegal logging in Mexico and a lack of milkweed in the Midwest United States for the butterflies to lay their eggs in has also taken a toll on the Monarchs ' population .
research published in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences -LRB- PNAS -RRB- suggests a link between male sexuality and conditions in the womb .
initial research by Dr. Anthony F. Bogaert and his colleagues at Brock University , Ontario revealed a possible link between the number of elder brothers a boy has and the likelihood he is to be gay .
whether this correlation be attributed to nature through the prenatal effects of the womb or to nurture through the psychosocial effects of growing up with elder siblings , however , remained unclear .
to further his research Bogaert studied 944 heterosexual and homosexual men .
the men were either `` biological ' ' brothers and shared the same mother or `` non-biological ' ' brothers through adoption or as half or step siblings .
Boegart reasoned that if the link between homosexuality and elder brothers was due to the nurturing effects of the family environment it would show regardless of any biological relationship .
the study showed , however , that the link was found only in biological brothers .
the amount of time an individual spent being raised with elder brothers had no bearing on sexual orientation ; the relationship was even found to be true in brothers who were raised apart from one another .
Bogaert writes in this month ' s PNAS : `` These results support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men and indicate that the fraternal birth-order effect is probably the result of a maternal ` memory ' for male gestations or births . ' '
he suggests that each male foetus prompts a progressively stronger immune reaction in the mother ' s body .
the antibodies that are produced by this reaction may account for sexual differentiation of the brain .
scientists from Michigan State University added in an accompanying article : `` These data strengthen the notion that the common denominator between biological brothers , the mother , provides a prenatal environment that fosters homosexuality in her younger sons . ' '
`` Increasingly , credible evidence appears to indicate that being gay is genetically determined rather than being a so-called lifestyle choice . ' '
it adds further weight to the argument that lesbian and gay people should be treated equally in society and not discriminated against for something that ' s just as inherent as skin color , ' ' said Andy Forrest , a spokesman for gay rights group Stonewall .
however ; Dr. Bogaert ' s study made no explanation for the origin of lesbianism .
only 44.47 percent of Romanian high school students passed last week ' s 2011 baccalaureate exam , according to the results published by Romanian education authorities on Sunday .
the baccalaureate exam in Romania is the secondary school educational qualification test , and passing it attests that a student has graduated high school and may be admitted to a university .
this is dramatically different from 69.3 percent last year and 81.4 percent in 2009 .
Sunday ' s passing figures are a record low since the exam was introduced in Romania and comes after new anti-fraud measures cut back on student cheating .
these included installing cameras in examination centres and forbidding students from paying teachers to obtain higher scores .
for this exam , 665 high school students were caught cheating , double the number from last year , and at one high school it was found that the exam answers were given to 111 pupils prior to the exam .
Caras Severin County reported the lowest rate with 24.82 percent graduation , and Suceava reported the highest with 65.03 percent , down from 87.39 percent in 2010 .
in Bucharest the rate was 42.03 percent , the lowest since the 1989 revolution .
the release of the results started a national debate on the possible causes of the drastic drop in scores , from the failure of parental participation , poor teacher pay and pay cuts , to student disinterest and lack of motivation .
critics say the educational system depends on rote learning and students are not taught to think independently .
at a press conference on Monday , Education minister Daniel Funeriu said , `` These results are a mirror of our society . ' '
`` Romania is now at a crossroads ... ' ' .
`` The nation should choose to encourage people who like to work rather than those who prefer cheating ' ' .
Cristian Alexandrescu , chief education inspector for Bucharest , argued that the exam was not taken seriously by students and the results prove that a student can not obtain a diploma without effort .
`` The moment of truth has come , ' ' Liliana Romanciuc , a school inspector in north-eastern Romania , told Mediafax .

British author James Graham Ballard , known as J. G. Ballard has died at the age of 78 .
Ballard died on Sunday after a long battle with prostate cancer .
according to a spokesperson , Ballard had been sick `` for several years ' ' and that it was `` with great sadness ' ' to have to make the announcement of his death .
Ballard is best known for writing the novels Crash in 1973 and Empire of the Sun in 1984 which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize .
`` He had grown up in Shanghai and had very good manners . ' '
`` He was very generous and polite and it took a long while before he would do anything that was n 't very controlled , ' ' said friend and author Iain Sinclair to The Times .
Ballard was born in Shanghai , China in the Shanghai International Settlement in 1930 .
when he was 12 , he and his family were forced to live in a camp run by Japanese forces during World War II .
Ballard says that he wo n 't say happy things about his experience in the camp , but also no unpleasant ones either .
in an interview with BBC News , Ballard said `` I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings-up that went on , but at the same time we children were playing a hundred and one games all the time . ' '
in 1946 he moved to the UK with his sister and mother where he began to write .
twenty years later , in the 1960 ' s , he employed himself as a full time writer .
he produced his first novel in 1961 titled The Wind from Nowhere and The Drowned World just a year later .

the Pakistani bowling , apart from a probing spell from paceman Rao Iftekar Anjum , was made to look ordinary .
when on 64 , Yuvraj was put down at covers by Shoaib Malik .
Tendulkar carried the drinks , indicating that in this Indian side experience and youth blended into one .
in Tendulkar ' s absence , Rahul Dravid opened the innings with Gautam Gambhir .
the left-handed Gambhir sparkled with a few pick-up shots on the leg-side ; this also showed Pakistan ' s pacemen were not bowling the right line .
Mohammed Asif has not been a big factor in the ODIs since the away going delivery is a lesser weapon in this variety of the game , especially if a side is bowling in the afternoon .
it was his two-way movement that made him so dangerous in Tests .
Gambhir once again wasted a start , but the opening pair had , importantly , raised 69 .
Dravid ' s 50 -LRB- 6x4 -RRB- might have consumed 82 deliveries , but he made sure that , in the absence of Virender Sehwag and Tendulkar , the Indians had enough wickets in hand before they began the final onslaught .
it was Sreesanth who dented Pakistan in the morning after Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar shared the new ball .
the Kerala paceman , who is learning fast , cut down on his pace realizing that there was not too much assistance for him from the wicket .
he struck thrice and Pakistan , from 62 without loss , slumped to 77 for three .
in the context of the match , Sreesanth ' s spell of 5-1-25-3 was crucial .
both Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal , after putting together 62 , fell to pull shots , and Shoaib Malik steered right into Suresh Raina ' s hands at gully .
there is fluency about Sreesanth ' s run-up and action that is hard to ignore , and he did bowl well at the death , swinging the ball into the right-hander .
and off-spinner Ramesh Powar won a leg-before decision against an ominous looking Inzamam on the sweep ; the delivery drifted into the right-hander from outside the off-stump and then straightened .
the bowlers , backed by aggressive fielding , had performed a fair job , under the conditions .

the State Route 520 floating bridge , a major conduit across Lake Washington to the technology-rich Eastside was closed and its drawspan opened to protect it from storm damage well into Friday .
local roads throughout the region were strewn with debris , especially evergreen branches and leaves .
four deaths were reported in connection with the storm as of Friday .
a Seattle woman died in the basement of her home after floodwaters caused the basement door to close and jam shut .
two others died in outlying areas after tall Northwest evergreens fell on their vehicles , and a man in Grays Harbor , near the Pacific coast , died in his sleep after a tree fell on his mobile home .
KOMO news reported a caller saying a 100-foot evergreen had fallen into his house .
downed trees and high winds also brought down powerlines throughout Western Washington .
Seattle City Light , the municipal electric utility for the city , reported a peak of 175,000 customers without power , most in the north and south ends of the city , as well as the east edge of town and the Green Lake area .
Puget Sound Energy , the electric utility for much of the Seattle metro area , reported 700,000 customers -LRB- over 66 % -RRB- without power , with the area around Seattle the worst hit .
PSE , which had already enlisted additional powerline workers from neighboring states , did not send crews out until mid Friday morning due to continued high winds .
estimates for power restoration were anywhere from a few days to over a week .
Island County , at the mouth of Puget Sound , was completely without power .
schools in Seattle and throughout its suburbs were closed Friday , many due to power outages .
the city of Mercer Island , connected to the mainland only by Interstate 90 , is reportedly inaccessible .
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer failed to print due to power failures at the printing facility , which had redundant power feeds from both the Seattle utility as well as PSE .
it is the first time in 70 years that the paper has not been printed .
the Seattle Times , a competing paper under a joint operating agreement , managed to print only 13,000 copies of its regular circulation of over 200,000 .
the papers located alternate facilities to print a reduced version of their Saturday editions , and their joint Sunday issue was also expected to be reduced .
at Sea-Tac Airport , three terminals were shut down overnight due to the storm .
Concourse A and the South Satellite terminal lost power , and a blown-out window caused Concourse C to also close .
all terminals were back in working order by midday Friday .
Likewise , in Oregon , Portland International Airport reported at least 40 flights canceled .
at Seattle ' s Boeing Field , winds flipped a private plane over , colliding with another plane .
the Seattle Seahawks vs. San Francisco 49ers football game was delayed 15 minutes .
a pre-game power surge temporarily took the Qwest Field ' s video displays offline .
the gridiron was plagued by standing water , as the stadium ' s loudspeakers played `` Who ' ll Stop The Rain ? ' ' shortly before kickoff .
Thursday night ' s storm comes after a previous regional storm in the Seattle area earlier in the week , in which trees in a few Seattle suburbs fell onto roads , powerlines , and two school buses .
in those incidents no one was hurt , and there were a few spotty power outages .
this is the second serious storm to hit the Northwest since Thanksgiving , In late November , record-setting snowfall had a similar disabling effect on the region .
the British tabloid The Daily Mirror today suggested that the London bombers may not have planned to commit suicide , while a Scotland Yard spokesman said they have not definitely confirmed that the four men intended to die when they carried out the attacks .
the Daily Mirror claims that the bombers brought return rail tickets to Luton , and that they purchased pay and display car park tickets before boarding the train at Luton Station .
the tabloid paper also states how the bombers all had personal items on their person at the time of the attacks , such as wallets , driving licences and bank cards .
it also states how they were carrying large rucksacks which could be easily dumped , instead of having the explosives strapped to their bodies , as would be expected of a suicide bomber .
it also points to evidence from the bombers ' families , where two of the men had pregnant wives .
from this evidence , the paper draws the conclusion that the four men were not told the bombs would detonate straight away , and that the men thought they would be able to escape unscathed .
this was probably done to protect their master ' s identity , the paper suggested , since there was a high probability the bombers would be caught had they lived .
a string of anti-government protests in Bangkok yesterday resulted in at least one fatality , numerous others injured , and the temporary closure of several foreign embassies in Thailand .
Philip Crowley , a spokesperson for the US State Department , announced early Thursday morning that the US embassy would be closed to the public due to its location near the violence .
the embassy will be operating with a reduced staff and will not offer American citizens services until the conflict is resolved .
the British and Dutch embassies in Thailand also halted their services after the Thai government said that it would seal off the area .
the leader of the protests was fugitive Major-General Khattiya Sawasdipol , the radical leader of the militant Red Shirt movement .
while giving interviews with foreign journalists , Sawasdipol appeared to have been shot in the head by a sniper .
he was later taken to a local hospital for emergency treatment .
one other protester , 25-year-old Chartchai Bualao , was killed in the incident , but it is still unclear as to who is responsible for the shooting .
Thai military forces moved in quickly to suppress the protesters just after the shooting , aiming to put down the opposition movement and secure the area in which they had barricaded themselves since early April .
the Thai government declared a state of emergency for seventeen of the country ' s 76 provinces in the wake of the protests .
this incident is only the latest in an ongoing series of violent outbreaks among protesters and the Thai government .
the violence is a result of the belief of the protesters that Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva took power through illegitimate means with the support of the Thai military .
following the escalation of investigations into St Stanislaus College in Bathurst , New South Wales , Australia , Wikinews has obtained a police statement from an alleged victim made in 1997 against priest Brian Joseph Spillane .
it had been believed that Bathurst detectives set up Strike Force Header after receiving a complaint from a former St Stanislaus student last year .
the complainant came to the police ' s attention after he came to Bathurst handing out fliers documenting alleged abuses at the school and providing a link to a website he had set up .
St Stanislaus College contacted police and asked them to investigate .
police contacted the alleged victim and asked him if he would like to make a complaint .

the King of Jordan , King Abdullah , dissolved the country ' s parliament on Tuesday , half-way through its four year term , and called for early general elections to be held , up to two years ahead of schedule .
the monarch did not immediately provide a reason for the move ; however , there have recently been reports accusing the parliament of handling legislation ineptly , and even of being corrupt .
the king ' s decree ordered the civil service to host new elections to replace the 110-member parliament , although an exact date for the polls has n 't yet been named .
critics of the parliament have said that its members did n 't properly address issues such as unemployment and poverty .
the opposition , however , asserted that the house had been disbanded so that the government could use emergency laws to pass legislation .
King Abdullah has now disbanded the parliament two times since he came to power in 1999 .

in the summer and on relief work , her smaller sister ship , the Queen of Prince Rupert also performs that run .
former Russian nuclear energy minister Yevgeny Adamov was arrested on Monday by Swiss authorities .
the arrest came at the request of U.S. officials who claim he stole more than nine million dollars allocated by Washington to help improve Russian nuclear safety .
the Ministry of Justice in Switzerland said Adamov will be extradited to the US .
the warrant allowing this states that he is charged with diverting money from the U.S. Department of Energy to several companies he controls .
Adamov ' s lead lawyer said he will fight the extradition warrant and called the accusations `` baseless ' ' .
Adamov , who has on a number of occasions been investigated for his financial dealing by the U.S. and Russia alike , said he was being punished for his help in building a nuclear plant in Iran .
the U.S. now has 60 days to present a formal request , after which a Swiss court will make a ruling .
Swiss officials said it is common for this process to take several months .
Adamov ' s U.S. lawyer , Larry Breur , said Adamov admitted to depositing the money into a personal account , but then he used that account to dispense the money to Russian agencies and nuclear scientists .
Breur said the process was common in Russia to avoid hypertaxation .
Yevgeny Adamov was a minister in Boris Yeltsin ' s government , but was removed from power by Vladimir Putin in an effort to remove corruption .
Adamov was in Bern attempting to unblock bank accounts belonging to his daughter .

she is contesting , for her party the National League for Democracy -LRB- NLD -RRB- , for Kawhmu , among the 48 seats in the election scheduled in April .
Suu Kyi is to contest in elections for the first time .

the military junta did not accept NLD ' s majority in that election .
the NLD objected to electoral laws and boycotted 2010 elections .
Kawhmu is a rural township in south-west Myanmar which was hit by cyclone Nargis in 2008 .
Suu Kyi ' s party would not have much power even if it won all the 48 available seats in the election .

Dutch adventurer Ralph Tuijn has reached the halfway point of his attempt to be the first person to row across the Pacific Ocean unaided .
the 16,000 kilometre journey from the coast of Peru to the seaside city of Brisbane , Australia , the widest section of the Pacific , has never been crossed absolutely unaided by a rower , and Tuijn says just nine people have rowed it even with assistance .
Tuijn reached the central point of his crossing , an insignificant point of water in the ocean , 111 days after setting off from Peru in March .
he has been making good progress , and has since cut his estimated time of arrival in Brisbane by a month .
the Dutchman , who now expects to reach his destination on October 20 , has kept in touch with those tracking his movements through daily internet postings from his laptop computer , including his wife Winnie .
his boat , the Zeeman Challenger , is a seven-metre custom plywood vessel .
Tuijn has overcome a variety of obstacles to reach the halfway point .
he is suffering from the constant attention of sharks , who often bump his boat and disrupt his attempts at sleep .
one particular shark , dubbed ` Gomulka ' by Tuijn , has been trailing the adventurer ' s boat for extended periods .
he has also accidentally burnt himself when he spilled hot water on his foot whilst trying to make coffee , apparently also from a shark ` bump ' .
he is also forced to manually pump water for cooking and drinking after his automatic water pump broke down not long into his journey .
his vessel has no motors or sails , but relies on his physical rowing power to move .
the boat does have a solar power system to provide energy for his laptop , a telephone and a global positioning system .
Tujin , who is raising money for a children ' s home in Mumbai , India , is rowing at an average speed of 58 kilometres each day .
his diet consists of freeze-dried foods and fish , which are keeping him physically well-conditioned despite tiring mentally .
he has rowed across the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea , as well as cycled across Russia and the icy terrain of Greenland .
Russian president Dmitry Medvedev followed the president of Georgia , Mikheil Saakashvili and signed the ceasefire agreement on Saturday .
the peace plan document was originally drafted by Nicolas Sarkozy , the President of France .
Medvedev announced during a meeting of the Russian Security Council that he had signed the document .
the truce was signed by Saakashvili on Friday , after a meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
following the meeting , a press conference was held in which Saakashvili stated that he had signed the accord .
but he pointed out that `` this is not a done deal . ' '
`` We need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future . ' '
by signing the agreement , both sides agree to pull back their forces to pre-conflict positions .
the accord allows certain concessions to both Georgia and Russia .
initially Medvedev said that he had ordered Russian troops to begin leaving Georgia on August 11 .
however , the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov refused to put a timetable on the withdrawal of Russian forces from deep inside Georgia and stated that their departure depended on extra security measures being put in place .
Lavrov also said Russia would strengthen its contingent in South Ossetia .
in a letter to Saakashvili , Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed that according to the signed peace plan , Russian forces are obliged to withdraw from all major Georgian towns regardless of the `` additional security measures ' ' mentioned in the document .
according to Sarkozy , these additional measures refer to the border area only .
at the same time Georgian internal affairs ministry reported that Russian forces changed the administrative borders of Abkhazia , and captured one of the Georgian power plants in the area .
it is also reported that Russian forces destroyed the strategic Georgian rail bridge in Kaspi .
according to Lavrov , the document Saakashvili signed differed from the one signed by Medvedev , lacking its introductory part .

two protesters in the United States who are associated with the ` Tar Sands Blockade ' were arrested Monday after they barricaded themselves inside a portion of the Keystone Oil Pipeline under construction in Winona , Texas .
TransCanada , which owns the pipeline , stopped construction once the protest began .
`` TransCanada Corporation did n 't bother to ask the people of this neighborhood if they wanted to have millions of gallons of poisonous tar sands pumped through their backyards , ' ' said one of the protesters inside the pipeline , Matt Almonte in a statement posted to the group ' s website .
`` This multinational corporation has bullied landowners and expropriated homes to fatten its bottom line ' ' , added Almonte .
Glen Collins , the second protester said , `` I ' m barricading this pipe with Tar Sands Blockade today to say loud and clear to the extraction industry that our communities and the resources we depend on for survival are not collateral damage . ' '
according to their website www.tarsandsblockade.org , Almonte and Collins entered the pipeline prior to about 7 : 30 a.m. local time .
they went 25 feet into the pipeline and took with them two barrels filled with cement , weighing 600 pounds each and locked themselves in between them .
at around noon , police on scene entered the section of pipe , only to emerge a few minutes later without the protesters .
at 12 : 30 , after an ambulance arrived on scene , police once again entered the pipe and began to pull on one of the barrels .
they were successfully removed and both Almonte and Collins were arrested .
a short time later a third protester , identified as Isabel Indigo Brooks , was also arrested .
in a statement to Wikinews , spokesperson for TransCanada Grady Semmens called the incident `` unfortunate ' ' saying , `` This project is about supplying Canadian and American oil to U.S. refineries , pushing out more expensive crude oil from foreign regimes that do not support American values of freedom and common sense -- Libya , Venezuela and the Middle East . ' '
`` It is unfortunate these protestors are trying to keep thousands of Americans from the jobs they depend on to provide for their families . ' '
`` This project is important not only to thousands of workers but also to Americans in general , ' ' added Semmens .
construction on portions of the pipeline were halted in January when the White House denied permits for it to be finished .
`` This announcement is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline , but the arbitrary nature of a deadline that prevented the State Department from gathering the information necessary to approve the project and protect the American people , ' ' said President Barack Obama in January .
the portion of the pipeline affected by the protesters is part of the ` Gulf Coast Pipeline Project ' that is to be about 485 miles long and consist of a `` 36-inch crude oil pipeline beginning in Cushing , Oklahoma and extending south to Nederland , Texas ' ' , says TransCanada on their website .
British architect Norman Foster and FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta presented today in Barcelona the redevelopment project for the team ' s stadium , Camp Nou , built in 1957 .
the Catalan club expects that this redesign will turn the stadium into a city landmark and that `` the external image of the stadium will become a recognized brand for FCB . ' '
the new stadium will be wrapped in a colorful mosaic made up of the team ' s colors -LRB- blue and red -RRB- and those of the Catalan flag -LRB- red and yellow -RRB- and reminiscent of Gaudi ' s style .
this reptile-like cover of tiles and lights will allow the stadium to transform itself according to the time of day and the events taking place .
the project also includes the building of a retractable roof .
according to the Club , `` the remodelled stadium is designed such that it can be built with minimal disruption to FCB normal football activity . ' '
the United States ' first major blizzard of the winter season has left much of the New England region covered in snow .
stretching from Virginia to Maine , the storm , packing winds of over 50 miles per hour -LRB- 80.5 kilometres per hour -RRB- , dropped more than two feet of snow in some areas .
residents prepared for what would be one of the worst nor 'easter s in quite some time .
the storm contained similar conditions to a category 2 hurricane .
Wellfleet , Massachusetts saw an 80 miles per hour wind gust , the strongest recorded throughout the storm .
Connecticut , New York and Maine all recorded wind gusts of over 60 miles per hour and gusts of over 70 miles per hour blasted Cape Cod .
a total of 32 inches -LRB- 81.3 centimetres -RRB- fell in Rahway , part of the hardest-hit state in the storm ' s path .
most New Jersey cities received over a foot of snow , while Connecticut , Delaware , Maine , and Maryland all had snow totals topping out at around 1 foot -LRB- 30.48 centimetres -RRB- with Massachusetts topping out at a foot and a half .
on Monday , travel proved difficult , with flights from Philadelphia , Newark , New York City , Hartford , Boston , Portland , and Washington , D.C. canceled .

Japanese media reported that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi suggested yesterday that the government would submit a draft to the Diet to rewrite the Imperial Household Act within the next year .
this is in response to a board of experts who have been investigating the succession issue .
the experts ' Board on the Imperial Household Act , personally appointed by the Prime Minister , reached an agreement on the issue that an Empress should be accepted .
implementation of their recommendations would mean that succession to the highest position in Japanese society would occur without a gender bias .
at the present time , the Japanese imperial household has no male member under the age of 20 ; present law only allows male descendants to ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne .
the proposed solution would put Princess Aiko , the sole child of Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako in place as the most likely to inherit the position of monarch , following behind would be Princess Sayako who will leave the Imperial Household due to her planned marriage with a commoner .
present law in Japan defines the succession as favoring male children ; the last time the country had an Empress was in 1771 , when Empress Go-Sakuramachi abdicated to her nephew .
despite the fact that there is precedent for an Empress , some scholars have suggested family members who previously broke ties with the recognized royal family following the end of World War II should be considered for the succession , opening up the field of candidates even more .
the group of scholars proposing this solution have stressed that their solution is aimed at maintaining the tradition of a male heir .
amongst the aftermath of a magnitude 8.9 earthquake which struck on Friday , followed by a tsunami , Naoto Kan , the prime minister of Japan , claimed that the country is experiencing its largest difficulties since the end of World War II in 1945 .
Kan reported that there were limited supplies of electricity due to the closure of numerous power stations , including a nuclear power plant located in Fukushima Prefecture .
according to NHK , a broadcasting organization in Japan , approximately 310,000 individuals have been transported to safety in shelters that , in various cases , do not contain electricity .
the Government of Japan has reported the deaths of one thousand individuals , although thousands of others have not been taken into account .
the police have claimed that the death toll in the Miyagi Prefecture as a result of the earthquake and tsunami could be in excess of ten thousand .
100,000 troops - which equates to approximately 40 % of the country ' s armed forces - are said to have been committed to assisting with the survivors of the disasters .
the nuclear agency of Japan consider the circumstances at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant to be Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale , which is an accident with local consequences .
according to BBC News Online , incidents like this usually cause one person to die from causes related to radiation .
no individuals from the power plant are reported to have died .
in the NHL the Buffalo Sabres beat the New York Islanders 3-0 in a shutout on Thursday night to tie the NHL record for the best start to a season .
`` I think we ' re all proud of what we ' ve accomplished so far . ' '
`` But at the end of the day , it ' s not what we ' re aiming for down the road , ' ' said Daniel Briere , the co-captain for the Sabres .
`` We want to be having these kinds of streaks in the playoffs . ' '
`` I think it will serve us well in the future , but right now we just need the points , ' ' said Ryan Miller , one of the Sabres goalies .
currently Buffalo is 10-0-0 and is currently the top team in the NHL .
they will play the Atlanta Thrashers , who trail the Sabres by only 3 points in the NHL overall , on Saturday October 28 .

oil prices attained a six-month high on Friday , on new signs that the U.S. economy may not be contracting as fast as was believed .
U.S. crude oil prices reached US $ 66.47 a barrel , a level not seen since last November .
Brent North Sea crude oil was up $ 1.13 to $ 65.52 at the end of the week , after peaking at $ 65.70 , also the highest level since November .
this comes soon after a report released by the U.S. Commerce Department showed that the U.S. GDP fell by 5.7 % , revised from the original figure of 6.1 % .
analysts predict that oil prices will continue to rise amid more positive economic news , especially from economic giants such as India and Japan .
`` Oil market participants ' conclusion that the worst of the recession has passed and that a recovery in demand must be at hand was bolstered overnight by higher than expected first quarter growth in India and a sharp jump in Japan ' s April industrial production , ' ' said MF Globa ' s John Kilduff .
`` We ' ve got a lot more optimism about the economic outlook than we did . ' '
`` The market is factoring in a recovery in demand by the end of the year , ' ' said an analyst for the Commodity Warrants Australia , Toby Hassall .
the Sunday Times cites unnamed U.K. government sources saying that Britain ' s troops could leave Basra as early as October .
this alleged scenario would allow Gordon Brown to announce a troop withdrawal in a statement at the time MPs return to Parliament .
the speculations have sparked criticism from U.S. military commentators this weekend .
General Jack Keane said the withdrawal had `` much more to do with conditions in the U.K. ' ' than with the situation in Iraq .
Frederick Kagan , of the American Enterprise Institute , said the expected withdrawal `` highlights the growing divergence between the British and American approach . ' '
just yesterday , former General Sir Mike Jackson called Donald Rumsfeld ' s approach to the U.S. presence in Iraq `` intellectually bankrupt ' ' .
an official statement from the British Ministry of Defense said that decisions about the number of troops in the Southern Iraqi province would take into account the position of the Iraqi and U.S. government .
the Ministry said that even after `` a competent Iraqi security force ' ' will have replaced them , some troops could still remain in Basra .
until now , Gordon Brown has consistently refused to set a time table for a pull-back .
the upper house of the former Kyrgyz parliament declared it was terminating its work `` to stabilize the situation and do away with conflicts ' ' on Tuesday , as the lower house had done a day before .
the decision was signed by 32 of the 45 deputies .
`` We think we have fulfilled our task , as far as was possible , especially in this time of trials , ' ' they said .
`` A huge part of the state system was devoted to the election process . ' '
`` That is not a secret ... ' '
`` We have all seen what happens when the executive branch gets involved in elections . ' '
`` I think we will not get into that now ... ' '
`` I think that staff should get back to work , ' ' he said .
`` Whoever is ... on my staff , if I hear that they got promoted for money or because they are someone ' s relative , or they belong to particular clan , then this person will be removed immediately , ' ' he added .
`` We will set up public hotline so that people can complain against corruption , ' ' he told them .
meanwhile , deposed president Askar Akayev ' s supporters said they would form a party and run a candidate in the presidential poll .
ousted emergencies minister Timirbek Akmataliyev and interior minister Keshenbek Dyushenbayev said they were forming the Akyikat -LRB- Fairness -RRB- political party .

in the lead-up to the federal election on September 7 , both leaders were focused on refugee policy with Abbott attacking Rudd for failing to effectively protect the country ' s borders by disbanding border protection agreements implemented by the previous Liberal government .
`` It ' s because Mr. Rudd closed it all down that we ' ve had more than 50,000 illegal arrivals , ' ' claimed Abbott .
`` There has been more than 800 boats , 11 billion dollars in budget blow-outs and tragically , more than 1000 deaths at sea . ' '
Rudd claimed that the policy he ' d put forward has `` one simple principle ' ' behind it : `` If you are a people smuggler bringing someone to Australia and you are seeking to settle them in Australia , we will not allow it . ' '
`` They will be sent for processing in Papua New Guinea . ' '
Rudd also used the debate to take a firm stance on same-sex marriage .
pledging that a bill to legalise same-sex marriage would be introduced within 100 days of government , Rudd promised to allow a `` full conscience vote ' ' if he were to be re-elected .
Rudd called on the opposition to do the same , describing it as a `` mark of decency ' ' and stating that `` folk out there want this to happen . ' '
Abbott , however , agreed that while same-sex marriage was an `` important issue ' ' , the economy was a more significant issue .

the New Zealand Government has been forced to act because of a letter sent to Prime Minister Helen Clark which claimed that the disease Foot and Mouth is being intentionally spread on Waiheke Island .
the letter , which is assumed to be a hoax , could have a major impact on New Zealand ' s meat industry .
Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton went so far as to say that the suspension of meat exports by some countries was a real possibility .
the incubation period of foot and mouth disease is such that if animals have been infected , signs should be evident within ten days .
in the meantime , Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry experts and veterinarians , many with experience gained in the recent United Kingdom outbreak , are conducting intensive monitoring of the Island ' s susceptible animals .
all sheep and cattle are being individually inspected every 48 hours .
meanwhile , restrictions on the movement of livestock are in place , so that in the very unlikely event that there has been a release of the disease , the effects will be contained .
police efforts are underway to track the origin of the letter that initiated the scare .
the Mexican government has said that an Aeroméxico Boeing-737 , flight 576 from Cancun , was hijacked and landed safely at Mexico City International Airport in Mexico City .
the situation ended without incident and all passengers and crew on board the aircraft were able to leave safely .
all hijackers were arrested after Mexican security forces boarded the plane .
the incident began just after 1 : 30 p.m. -LRB- CDT -RRB- one man took control of the plane and demanded to speak to Felipe Calderon , Mexico ' s president .
the hijacker said that if his demand was not met , he would blow up the plane .
earlier reports had stated there were explosives on board the aircraft , but none were found .
a short time later , four of the detained men were released without being charged .
authorities identified the sole hijacker as Jose Mar Flores , 44 , who is being described as an alcoholic , drug addicted , religious fanatic .
he claims he was on a mission to warn Mexico that an earthquake was going to strike the country .
Flores said that the significance of the date , 9 / 9 / 09 , the reverse of 666 , was the reason why he hijacked the plane .
reports say he was carrying a box that he described as a bomb and would detonate it if his demand to speak to Calderon about the quake was not met .
104 people were on board the plane , but all passengers and crew aboard the aircraft have left it safely .
the airport remained open while the plane was dealt with on an emergency runway .
Calderon was inside the airport ' s presidential hangar waiting to depart when the plane landed .

families of Spanish sailors being held for over a month appealed to Spain ' s government on Friday to negotiate with the Somali pirates for their release .
the kidnappers have threatened to kill three of the tuna trawler ' s crew after a stand-off with Spanish forces .
they called upon the government to free two captured Somalis held in Spain , who are suspected of being involved in the seizure of the Alakrana and its crew of 36 .
as in the case with the Lynn Rival , a British yacht , the kidnappers have demanded their release .
Ricardo Blach , the captain of the trawler who is being held by the pirates , warned relatives by phone that they intended to kill the three crew members -- moved from the trawler on Thursday and returned on Friday in a bid to pressure the Spanish government -- should their demands not be met .
`` They have just told us that if in three days there is no change over the two held in Spain , they will kill the three and then three others and then more , ' ' he said .
the Spanish government has ruled this out , but is willing to hand them over to an African country , such as Kenya , as happened in May .
`` That is an issue for the courts to decide , ' ' commented Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega Sanz to reporters , adding that talking about this `` technical topic which is legally very complicated ' ' was `` risky ' ' .
Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos stressed the need for calm amongst the tension of the removal and return of the three hostages .
`` What does this mean ? ' '
' ' it means we must remain calm . ' '
`` Kidnappings are complicated situations , with highs and lows , they are very difficult and stressful . ' '
`` But we must remain confident and calm , ' ' he said during a news conference .
`` If we remain calm and confident I am certain that what all Spaniards want , what the families want , what the government wants -- that the hostages can return to their homes safe and sound and this kidnapping ends satisfactorily . ' '
families say the captured crew have `` little drinking water or food , ' ' .
they called for Spanish authorities to `` act immediately ' ' and `` do everything possible to bring home the 36 fishermen . ' '
`` We demand that all the parties work in the same direction ' ' and requested that the Spanish government chooses `` negotiation ' ' as opposed to risking the life of the crew in danger by forceful means .
the pirates captured the boat on October 2 , and are demanding US $ 4 -LRB- $ 2.6 -RRB- million in ransom in addition to the release of the two captured Somalis .
the crew comprises sixteen Spaniards , the crew includes eight Indonesians and members from Ghana , the Ivory Coast , Madagascar , Senegal and the Seychelles .
Spanish military captured the two suspected pirates when they left the trawler via a small boat .
on Friday , Spain ' s secretary of state for defense , Constantino Mendez , insisted that their release `` is not negotiable . ' '
he announced on Spanish National Radio that the hostages are `` in good health ' ' and that the kidnappers are `` dramatising ' ' the situation as a `` negotiating tactic . ' '
two Spanish frigates are observing the situation off the Somali coast .
Queensland Australia ' s Sir Joh Bjelke Petersen , a controversial figure who served as the State ' s Premier for 19 years and reigned over the government that later became the subject of the Fitzgerald Inquiry , has died in hospital at Kingaroy , aged 94 .
`` By any measurement , Sir Joh was an exceptional state builder who will be remembered for consistently placing Queensland first , ' ' said the Australian Governor General , Major General Jeffery , in a statement .
Australian Prime Minister , John Howard : `` He was certainly a strong political figure and I extend my condolences to his wife and his family . ' '
but not all voices were sympathetic , prominent Queensland Aboriginal activist Sam Watson for example : `` Aboriginal people will always remember him as a racist , a thug and a dictator . ' '
having suffered severe ill-health for some weeks , and declining health for years , Sir Joh passed away at around 6pm AEST .
he was surrounded by his family , who had been summoned yesterday by Lady Flo , his wife and one-time Senator , for final goodbyes .
Phrases such as `` Do n 't you worry about that ' ' and `` Goodness gracious me ' ' were like trademarks to the maverick leader .
known simply as ` Joh ' to many , he would famously describe press conferences as ` feeding the chooks ' .
today Kingaroy locals taunted waiting press with cries from `` You ' re chooks , you ' re chooks , ha ha ' ' to `` Go home , ya vultures ' ' , and some obscenities , reported the Courier-Mail of Brisbane .
his fall from power at the end of the 80s was surrounded in controversy , with the state embroiled in corruption findings going to the level of his deputies , and Bjelke Petersen ' s claims of ignorance coming under challenge with charges of perjury .
the case was never heard due to a controversial hung jury : the foreman of the jury , Luke Shaw , had been an office-bearer of the Young Nationals -- an arm of Bjelke Petersen ' s National Party -- as well as a member of a group calling themselves ` Friends of Joh ' .
having had his start in life as a peanut farmer in remote Kingaroy , the former Premier was fit up until the very end , but palsy was paralyzing his muscles and organs , to which he eventually succumbed .
`` Throughout his life Sir Joh combined enormous energy , vision and an immense capacity for hard work , most especially during his 19-year term as Premier of Queensland , ' ' the Governor General said .
`` What looked to us to be huge risks at the time turned out to be nation building , ' ' said Bob Katter , a former minister of Joh ' s Government , who credited Sir Joh with starting the Queensland coal , aluminum and tourism industries .
he is also remembered for dismantling many of the State ' s unions , and for a somewhat totalitarian and heavy handed style of keeping control .
under Joh , street protests were banned and Special Branch monitored extensively those the authoritarian leader saw as subversives , measures prompting Queenslander , Australian Civil Liberties Council , Terry O 'Gorman , to comment Sir Joh was `` the most appalling premier Queensland has ever had in terms of civil liberties and human rights ' ' .
Joh was also influential in the famous case of the Dismissal by the Governor General of then-Prime Minister Gough Whitlam , in 1975 .
in his last years as Premier , he had taken his cause to the nation ' s capital , with the `` Joh for PM ' ' campaign .
but this distraction has been credited with the downfall of his government , with corruption investigations at last being conducted by his stand-in , Bill Gunn .
the body of Sir Joh , who was of Lutheran faith , is to be buried at Bethany , the family property near Kingaroy .
Finland now holds the world record for the longest non-stop round of karaoke singing .
the country already holds the record for the largest number of karaoke singers at any given time .
the previous record was 145 hours , as held by China .
however , in a karaoke bar in Kouvola , a small town on Finland ' s southern coast , the record was surpassed on Wednesday , with the ultimate goal being 240 hours non-stop .
Finns traveled long distances to participate at the event , which was broadcast live on the internet .
the record goes alongside Finland ' s other record for karaoke , that of the largest number singing at any given time .
this is held by 80,000 fans of the Finnish hard rock band Lordi , who had met in Helsinki for the band to give a brief free concert to celebrate their victory at that year ' s Eurovision .
the show culminated with all 80,000 joining in with the band on the winning song , Hard Rock Hallelujah .
Hawker , Australian Capital Territory -- Tonight , the Japanese national team beat the Australian Capital Territory -LRB- ACT -RRB- softball team 1 -- 0 in the first of a two game series before Japan plays a three game test series against the Australian national team .
Japan brought five pitchers to Canberra for their Australian tour .
since the last Olympics , Japan has been in a rebuilding period .
the side is young and many of their best players have not had much international experience .
one of their best pitchers is only nineteen years old .
the ACT side included Australian national team members Aimee Murch and Clare Warwick ; Olympic bronze medalist Brenda De Blaes ; Victorian state team representative , national team member and Olympic bronze medalist Justine Smethurst ; and Clare Currie , who narrowly missed the cut for the national team .
de Blaes started the top of the first with a hit .
Murch was pitching for the ACT to start the bottom of the first .
number 15 for Japan opened the inning with a single , and was advanced to third on another single .
she was tagged out after trying to score a run after her teammate hit a pop up caught by the ACT ' s center fielder .
number 6 hit a double during this inning , scoring Japan ' s only run .
the top of the second saw ACT players 1 , 5 and 3 tagged out after hits to the infield .
the bottom of the second saw number 13 out on a foul ball caught on the fly by the ACT ' s third baseman , and number 11 and 24 out on balls hit into and caught by the ACT ' s center fielder .
the top of third inning saw numbers 24 and 21 ground out .
the bottom of the third saw Japan ' s first batter ground out , number 8 getting a single on an infield hit , another playing getting an out , and the inning ending with number 11 hitting an infield ground out .
the rest of the game followed much the same pattern .
two players , an ACT player and a Japanese , were struck by balls and required trainers to look at them .
Smethurst came in and pitched a few innings in relief .
between the fifth and sixth innings , there was a small delay in the game when a dog named Streaker , owned by Australia men ' s national softball team player Adam Folkard , ran onto the the infield .
an announcement was made at the end of the game that the match scheduled for tomorrow would start fifteen minutes earlier than the advertised start time of 18 : 00 .
the Pentagon has confirmed that US forces began an on-going operation of airstrikes in southern Somalia on Monday , and that the attacks , targeted at Islamic militia , are continuing .
Somalia ' s president had earlier said that the United States was pursuing suspects of the 1998 United States embassy bombings .
it is believed that the militants are sheltering the suspects .
an attack against Ras Kamboni -- a remote island near the Kenyan border , represents the first American involvement in the tumultuous country since the the 1993 operation that resulted in the deaths of as many as 1,500 Somali militiamen and civilians .
a Somali Defense Ministry official has additionally reported that American helicopters launched an attack against ICU fighters in Afmadow , a city near the Kenyan border , 350 kilometres southwest of Mogadishu .
the AC-130 gunship attack killed an unknown number of civilians , alternatingly reported as 4 , 19 or 31 .
so far , three people -LRB- including a baby -RRB- have been killed , and at least ten others were injured when two semi trucks collided in a tunnel on Interstate 5 -LRB- Newhall Pass -RRB- between Los Angeles and Santa Clarita California , United States in the late evening of October 12 , setting off a chain reaction pileup that involved between 28 and 30 semi trucks and one passenger car .
the wreck caused a massive fire that burned for over six hours .
it was previously believed that only 13 semi trucks were involved .
`` The fire burned in a very intense state for approximately four hours and basically consumed everything that was burnable , ' ' said John Tripp the Fire Chief for L.A. county .
as a result of the crash , the Governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a declaration of a state of emergency for Los Angeles County .
the debris has been removed and officials say that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because the structure of the tunnel has been compromised .
`` None of the rebar appears to be melted , damaged at this point in time . ' '
`` But it ' s completely separated from the walls in a number of areas , so we lose vertical support when that happens , ' ' said California Department of Transportation official , Doug Failing .
Tripp added that more bodies could be buried in the wreckage , saying ' ' ... we ' re going to have to do a very methodical search . ' '
`` There could be unfortunately more people that were not able to escape . ' '
so far authorities have yet to identify the three people who were killed .
a full investigation is being conducted into what caused the crash .
sparking controversy and eliciting widespread condemnation in an interview with the Washington Post , Pakistan ' s President , Pervez Musharraf , has made some poorly-judged comments about rape and rape victims .
Musharaff was quoted as having said , `` Rape has become a money-making concern ' ' and he suggested that getting raped was a method of getting a visa to western countries .
the high-profile rape victim , Mukhtar Mai , dismissed the idea that any woman could allow herself to be subjected to such treatment for money .
her case attracted widespread international media attention with it being alleged that her rape was ordered by the local panchayat -LRB- town council -RRB- .
the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner has questioned Australia ' s tough asylum seeker policies this week , stating that Australia ' s mandatory detention regime has `` cast a shadow ' ' over its human rights record .
Navi Pillay , the UN ' s Human Rights watchdog , was particularly critical of Prime Minister Julia Gillard ' s asylum seeker trade deal with Malaysia .
this bilateral agreement , if signed , would see 800 refugees attempting to get to Australia by boat immediately transported to Malaysia instead .
in return , Australia would take 4,000 genuine refugees from Malaysia over a space of four years .
however , Malaysia has not signed either the international Refugee Convention , or the Convention Against Torture .
in an interview with the ABC , Ms Pillay voiced concern over this , stating that Australia may `` violate refugee law ' ' by sending asylum seekers to a country where no laws are in place to protect them .
Pillay , a South African former anti-apartheid protester , also voiced distress over the omnipresence of political `` demonising ' ' of these asylum seekers stating , ' ' [ t ] he consequence of the constant political refrain that Australia is being ` flooded ' by people who are ` queue jumpers ' has resulted in a stigmatisation of an entire group of people , irrespective of where they have come from or what dangers they have fled ' ' .
in her six-day trip to Australia , the UN Human Rights Commissioner visited two detention centres and said she was overwhelmed with the `` grim despondency ' ' of asylum seekers , many of whom wait over 18 months to have their case assessed .
the mistreatment of refugees was today reinforced with the release of an Australian Rights Commission report , which revealed extensive problems of self-harm and depression among detainees at the Villawood Detention Centre in Sydney .
the United States Senate has defeated a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage .
the bill was defeated 48 to 49 and did not receive the minimum amount of 60 votes to that would allow the bill to be taken to the full Senate .
the bill fell 18 votes short of the 67 that were needed for approval .
in order for the bill to become part of the U.S. Constitution , this bill would have had to be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives , then be approved by the legislatures of three fourths -LRB- that is , 38 -RRB- of the States .
however , Senator David Vitter , R-LA , who is a supporter of the bill says , `` we ' re building votes . ' '
`` Most Americans are not yet convinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are likely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples , ' ' said John McCain -LRB- R-AZ -RRB- who opposed the bill .
`` A vote for it is a vote against civil unions , against domestic partnership , against all other efforts for states to treat gays and lesbians fairly under the law , ' ' said Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy .
the bill would define marriage as between a man and a woman , and would preclude the official recognizing of same-sex marriages .
the bill is expected to be taken back to the Senate in July .
US lawmakers have reached a last-minute deal to avoid a government shutdown , which would have begun at 12 : 00 EDT -LRB- 04 : 00 UTC -RRB- Saturday .
the agreement , announced just one hour before the shutdown was to occur , includes US $ 38.5 billion in budget reductions .
earlier on Friday , US legislators deflected claims that a midnight deal was being worked out , but Republican Party sources later reported that a deal was likely to be reached .
the deal was apparently reached after disputes over government funding for organizations such as Planned Parenthood were resolved .
Boehner said both sides decided on a six-day extension , or `` bridge , ' ' of government funding , which would allow Congress to work out a final solution to last the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year , which ends in September .
voting for the resulting agreement will take place some time next week , according to Boehner .
the last complete US government shutdown occurred in 1995 , during the administration of Bill Clinton , lasting five days ; it was proceeded by a 21-day partial shutdown .
in the event of a government shutdown , essential federal employees are still required to work , but nonessential personnel are placed on unpaid furloughs .
essential staff include military personnel , air traffic controllers , emergency officials , and intelligence officials .
in the Philippines , the Liberal Party ' s presidential candidate Benigno Simeon Cojuangco Aquino III , commonly known as Noynoy , was officially elected as the next President of the Philippines in the 2010 presidential election .

he is 50 years old , a bachelor , an economics graduate , a Senator and is the only son of former President Corazon Aquino and former Senator Benigno Aquino , Jr . .
Noynoy ' s father was shot while in military custody during the regime of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos , before his mother , Corazon Aquino , led the People Power Revolution that toppled Marcos in 1986 .
in the Philippines , the president and vice president are elected separately ; the Puwersa ng Masang Pilipino Party ' s vice-presidential candidate Jejomar Cabauatan Binay will become the country ' s vice-president .

two US soldiers killed in Afghanistan yesterday were shot by an Afghan interpreter in Wardek province south-west of Kabul , according to NATO .
an official said the translator shot them at an eastern Afghanistan outpost before he was shot dead by other soldiers .
it is not yet clear why the interpreter started shooting ; However , the attacker seemed to be a `` disgruntled employee ' ' , as opposed to a militant , according to a US military official .
the interpreter had supposedly argued with the soldiers over pay and treatment before opening fire .
NATO originally only released a terse statement yesterday , stating that two soldiers and one civilian had been killed .
elsewhere in Wardek province , four Afghan soldiers died in an airstrike by coalition forces .
it is not thought that the two incidents are related .
NATO called the deaths `` regrettable ' ' and is to carry out an investigation .
the Afghan defense ministry is demanding punishment for the `` murderers ' ' responsible for the airstrike .
the Australian federal and New South Wales governments will not be selling their shares in Snowy Hydro Limited -LRB- the owner and operator of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme -RRB- .
Snowy Hydro Limited ' s major shareholder is the NSW government with a 58 percent shareholding .
the Victorian government owns 29 percent and the federal government has a 13 percent stake .
NSW Premier Morris Iemma announced in December 2005 that he wished to sell the state ' s share in Snowy Hydro that caused the federal and Victorian governments to follow .
the proposed sale has attracted immense criticism by those who believed that the sale would affect the environment and water supplies along the Snowy River , this was reinforced yesterday when 58 eminent Australians presented a petition to the government opposing the sale .
Prime Minister John Howard announced today that the federal government would not be selling its 13 percent share of Snowy Hydro following what he calls `` intense community reaction ' ' .
in a statement , Mr Howard said , `` This decision to sell the Snowy Hydro has created significant unhappiness , concern and unrest throughout the Australian community . ' '
Mr Howard said that the sale was not an election promise by his government and that the federal government failed to see any long-term benefits from the sale .
he also said that the government needed to `` safeguard the interests of all those dependent on Australia ' s iconic water resources ' ' .
the federal government has however stated that despite refusing to sell its share in Snowy Hydro that it will not be purchasing additional shares if NSW and Victoria push ahead with the sale of their shareholdings .
despite telling Macquarie Radio earlier this morning that his government would be pushing ahead with the sale as it was in the best `` interests of NSW ' ' , Premier Iemma announced shortly after Mr Howard ' s release , that the NSW government would be withdrawing its shares from sale .
Mr Iemma conceded that the sale would be extremely difficult with the federal government withdrawing its 13 percent from sale .
`` The Prime Minister has pulled the rug out from under the sale , ' ' Mr Iemma said .
`` The Commonwealth decision makes it extremely difficult for NSW to proceed , ' ' he conceded .
Victoria is yet to announce whether or not it will be withdrawing its shares from sale .
scientists using NASA ' s Swift Satellite and other telescopes have observed a supernova in near real time occurring in the constellation of Aries .
the explosion is said to be the most powerful explosion known to scientists , which consists of a gamma-ray burst or an x-ray blast .
scientists say that bursts signal the beginning of a star ' s death .
Swift first detected the explosion on February 18 -LRB- it was given a designation GRB 060218 -RRB- , which allowed telescopes and satellites to watch the event as it happened .
the blast lasted for more than 2,000 seconds -LRB- 33 minutes -RRB- .
`` This is the type of unscripted event in our nearby universe that we hoped Swift could catch , ' ' said Neil Gehrels , Swift principal investigator at NASA ' s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .
`` Those observations capture the time when the star collapsed , ejected its outer envelope and most of its mass and left a compact remnant behind . ' '
`` And we think that compact remnant is a neutron star , ' ' said an author writing for journal Nature , where the report will be published on Thursday .
scientists are also planning on using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory in an attempt to get more images of the event .
the star is at least 440 million light years from Earth .
the group of scientists was led by Sergio Campana of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics and Alicia Soderberg , a graduate student at Caltech in Pasadena , California .
the primary camera on the Hubble Space Telescope has shut down and is likely to only be restored to partial functionality , according to reports from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -LRB- NASA -RRB- .
the camera on the telescope , known as the `` Advanced Camera for Surveys ' ' or ACS , can be reactivated but will be restored to only one-third of its operating capacity .
the camera shut down over the weekend , probably due to a failure of its backup power supply .
it was the third such shutdown of the camera in the past calendar year .
the camera had been operating on its backup power since June 30 , 2006 , when engineers switched from the primary power supply -LRB- `` Side A ' ' -RRB- to the backup -LRB- `` Side B ' ' -RRB- due to a malfunction .
a review board was convened on January 29 to assess all options and to decide on a course of action .
their findings will be reported to NASA on March 2 , 2007 .
the ACS , developed jointly by four American agencies , was installed in March of 2002 .
it is a system of three cameras , filters , and dispersers which act to detect wavelengths of light ranging from near-infrared to ultraviolet .
it is a system that was designed to last five years , according to Preston Burch , associate director and program manager for the Hubble Space Telescope .
NASA also indicated that the other four main systems on the telescope remain unaffected and functioning normally .
a scheduled mission to the space telescope in 2008 is expected to deliver instruments to further upgrade the capabilities of the telescope .
it is not known what the effect of the ACS failure will have on the scheduled mission .
Burch said in a press release posted on the NASA main website , `` It is important that the review board conduct a thorough investigation that will allow us to determine if there are any changes needed in the new instruments that will be installed on the upcoming servicing mission so that we can be sure of maximizing the telescope ' s scientific output . ' '
`` We are continuing to make excellent progress in our preparations for the servicing mission , which is presently targeted to fly in September 2008 . ' '
one day after France began enforcing a ban on the public wearing Islamic veils that cover the face , either a niqāb or a burqa , French police briefly detained two veiled women .
the police later claimed that the women were arrested for taking part in an unauthorized protest , not because they were wearing veils .
the women were arrested while outside the famed Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris , and may now face fines of up to $ 217 -LRB- 150 euros -RRB- , community service and / or a citizenship course under the law .
while the ban covers the burqa and the niqāb , it does not include the hijab or the chador .
the hijab is a veil that leaves the face visible while covering the hair and neck , and the chador covers only the body .
the law has stirred much debate , both in France and around the globe .
those who oppose the new law say it limits freedom of speech and freedom of religion , while supporters claim that women are degraded by wearing veils and the law is intended to empower those women , as well as increase public security .
the French government , in defense of the ban , said that it was necessary because wearing veils falls short of the living standards in France and and makes women be of an lower status in a country where everybody is considered equal .
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon has said that the ban is consistent with the national values of France .
`` The French Republic lives in a bare-headed fashion , ' ' he said in a statement published by a government newspaper .
the French government previously made efforts to accommodate Muslims in the country , including establishing a council dealing with the presence of Islam ; however , according to Amer Sahar , a professor who studies the topic , some Muslims in the country say that they feel as though they are under assault by the government .
she said that some are `` resentful of the fact that they are not allowed to be both Muslim and French . ' '
the French government is also concerned with women and children who are forced to veil themselves .
it has said that such an action is `` a new form of enslavement that the republic can not accept on its soil . ' '
activist Rachid Nekkaz auctioned one of his homes to provide money to pay the fine for any woman arrested under the law .
`` I would like to send a clear message to President Nicolas Sarkozy that we can do what we want . ' '
`` We have a constitution and everyone has to respect it , ' ' he said .
according to the French Constitutional Council , the law `` conforms to the Constitution ' ' because it does not limit the freedom of religion or excessively punish people for exercising that right in a place of worship .
a controversial patent directive has been thrown out in a landslide vote .
648 MEPs out of 680 voted today to reject the proposal , aimed at bringing Europe in-line with a similar U.S. bill .
`` This is a great victory for those who have campaigned to ensure that European innovation and competitiveness is protected from monopolisation of software functionalities and business methods . ' '
`` It marks the end of an attempt by the European Commission and governmental patent officials to impose detrimental and legally questionable practices of the European Patent Office -LRB- EPO -RRB- on the member states , ' ' said the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure , in opposition to the directive .
adversaries to the patent directive claim that a bill covering Intellectual Property -LRB- IP -RRB- would `` stifle innovation ' ' in Europe , as it allows the patenting of implementation within software .
many anti-patent activists say that if the bill were passed , small businesses and hobbyists would be in danger of lawsuit from corporations and their extensive patent portfolios .
United States President Barack Obama is seeking a `` comprehensive exit strategy ' ' from the Afghanistan war .
during a 60 Minutes interview , Obama said , `` There ' s got to be an exit strategy . ' '
`` There ' s got to be a sense that this is not perpetual drift . ' '
in February Obama said that 17,000 more troops would be sent this year before the August elections to supplement the 36,000 American troops already deployed in Afghanistan .
Obama stated that the U.S. Mission in Afghanistan is `` making sure that al-Qaeda can not attack the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests and our allies . ' '
options for a strategy include improving Afghan-Pakistani relations , while rebuilding Afghanistan ' s economy .
`` I found a very encouraging symmetry of views between our NATO allies and other troop-contributing countries and the United States , ' ' Richard Holbrooke , U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan stated .
`` In the past , the United States government stove-piped it , they had an Afghan policy and a Pakistan policy . ' '
`` We have to integrate the two and I hope the rest of the world will join us in that effort , ' ' said Holbrooke .
Obama also said that `` the complexities of Afghanistan are matched , maybe even dwarfed , by the complexities of the economic situation . ' '
`` There needs to be a way to withdraw from Afghanistan and place the focus on economic growth . ' '
`` We may need to bring a more regional diplomatic approach to bear . ' '
`` We may need to coordinate more effectively with our allies . ' '
`` But we ca n 't lose sight of what our central mission is . ' '
European allies have stated they have exit plans for the next three to four years .
Hamid Karzai , the Afghan President says that although he supports the idea , he urges that there is no need for any `` quick fixes ' ' .
representative Tom Tancredo -LRB- R-CO -RRB- has clarified his earlier statement that `` you could take out their holy sites , ' ' in the event of a nuclear attack upon the U.S. by Islamic terrorists .
Rep. Tancredo has refused to make any apologies , saying `` When we bombed Hiroshima , when we bombed Dresden , we punished a lot of people who were not necessarily -LRB- guilty -RRB- . ' '
`` Not every German was a member of the Nazi Party . ' '
however , Tancredo emphasized that he was speaking hypothetically and not necessarily suggesting policy .
the remarks , made in a July 15th radio interview , hosted by Pat Campbell of WFLA in Orlando , Florida , have drawn support from conservatives groups such as Northeast Intelligence Network and Free Republic , and have offended the American Muslim community .
veteran White House journalist Helen Thomas , 89 , announced her retirement yesterday with immediate effect , ending her fifty-seven year career , amid criticism over controversial remarks .
Thomas has been a correspondent for over fifty years and has covered every president from John F. Kennedy to Obama .
Thomas , the daughter of Lebanese immigrants , who blazed a trail for female reporters in politics in the United States , has ended her career after apologizing for saying that Israel should `` get the hell out of Palestine . ' '
in retiring , Thomas stated : `` I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians . ' '
`` They do not reflect my heart-felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance . ' '
her departure as Hearst Newspaper columnist was announced after she was captured on video saying : `` Remember , these people are occupied and it ' s their land . ' '
`` It ' s not Germany , it ' s not Poland , ' ' and that Israelis should `` get the hell out of Palestine ' ' and `` they should go home ' ' to Poland , Germany , the US and `` everywhere else . ' '
Rabbi David Nesenoff , an independent filmmaker , said he spoke to Thomas outside the White House on Jewish Heritage Day on May 27 .
video of her controversial comments were widely disseminated on the Internet by his website , rabbilive.com , that relaunched last week .
she was dropped by her public speaking agency and a high school commencement address was canceled .
the Hearst statement came shortly after White House press secretary Robert Gibbs called her remarks `` offensive and reprehensible . ' '
Thomas has been a correspondent for fifty-seven years , she had worked for decades as a White House correspondent for United Press International and became a columnist for the Hearst newspaper chain in recent years .
she was the first female officer of the National Press Club , the first female member and president of the White House Correspondents Association , and , in 1975 , the first female member of the Gridiron Club .
Thomas did little to hide her views , with her questions to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and their press secretaries often about the wars in the Middle East .
two weeks ago , she asked Obama , `` Mr. President , when are you going to get out of Afghanistan ? ' '
`` Why are you continuing to kill and die there ? ' '
`` What is the real excuse ? ' '
' ' and do n 't give us this Bushism , ` If we do n 't go there , they ' ll all come here . ' ''
during Kennedy ' s administration , Helen ended all presidential press conferences with a signature `` Thank you , Mr. President ' ' and always issued a caveat about her work : `` In my career you ' re only as good as your last story . ' '
police in Austria have reported that the situation in the cellar where people were illegally imprisoned for over two decades is ` oppressive ' .
they have also said that they can not stay in the cellar for more than one hour .
AP reported that this is because there is a low oxygen level in the cellar .
this announcement by the police comes after police in the Lower Austrian town of Amstetten arrested a 73 year old man who is alleged to have kept his daughter , now aged 42 , locked in the cellar of his house in Amstetten since August 29 , 1984 .
the man , identified by police as Josef Fritzl , is alleged to have started sexually abusing his daughter , named as Elisabeth Fritzl , when she was eleven years old , and to have subsequently fathered seven children by her .
one of the children , one of a set of twins born in 1996 , died of neglect shortly after birth and the body was burned by the father .
the surviving six children , three boys and three girls , are currently aged between 5 and 20 years old .
three of the children were left on Josef F. ' s doorstep and subsequently raised as the adoptive children of Josef F. and his wife , Rosemarie , while the other three children were left with their mother and never saw daylight until she was discovered .
Rosemarie F. is said to have been unaware of her husbands ' activities .
police became suspicious when a 19-year-old daughter , Kerstin , was taken to hospital with a mysterious life-threatening illness , and the family ' s medical records were checked .
police say that Elisabeth F. appeared to be `` greatly disturbed ' ' psychologically , and only agreed to talk after the authorities assured her that she would not have to have contact with her father , and that her children would be cared for .
the local authorities have recently released a statement regarding these incidents , an English translation of part of which is available below :
the news has shocked Austria , as has its similarity to the case of Natascha Kampusch who was kidnapped aged 10 , and escaped after being held in a `` dungeon ' ' for eight years in 2006 .
the first charges under the new U.K. International Criminal Court Act have been brought against seven British servicemen .
the charges relate to the mistreatment of civilians and the death of Baha Mousa -LRB- 26 -RRB- a hotel receptionist in Basra in 2003 .
the charges include manslaughter , inhumane treatment , causing actual bodily harm , and common assault of Iraqi civilians .
a Warrant Officer and a Major in the British Intelligence Corps and the former commander of the Queen ' s Lancashire Regiment -LRB- now the Duke of Lancaster ' s Regiment -RRB- are charged with negligently performing duties .
the first British serviceman to give evidence , a senior aircraftsman in the RAF , testified that he saw prisoners with bags over their heads being kicked and verbally abused .
he said that he had never seen anything like it before and did n 't know what to do .
he had not intervened `` because they -LRB- the soldiers -RRB- were bigger than me , and I did n 't know what their orders were ' ' .
the court martial at the Military Court Centre , Bulford Camp , Wiltshire continues .
two British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan on Wednesday , with one being the highest ranking British officer to be killed in 30 years .
Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe , 40 , Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards , and Trooper Joshua Hammond , 18 , of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment , were killed when an improvised explosive device was detonated under their Viking armored vehicle .
they had been traveling along the Shamalan Canal , near Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province , on their way to resupply an offensive underway currently against the Taliban .
General Sir Richard Dannatt , the UK Chief of the General Staff , said Thornloe was `` an outstanding commanding officer . ' '
in a Ministry of Defense -LRB- MoD -RRB- statement , Dannatt said , ' ' [ Thornloe ' s ] courageous , thoughtful stewardship of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards since October last year has seen them superbly prepared for the demands of Afghanistan , both in terms of their professional capability and their unbreakable spirit as a team . ' '
trooper Hammond , Danntt said in the MoD statement , `` was a first class tank crewman who epitomised the spirited and determined approach to operations expected of Royal Armoured Corps soldiers . ' '
Lieutenant Colonel Thorneloe is survived by his wife , Sally , and daughters Hannah and Sophie .
IBM ' s T.J. Watson Research Center in Cambridge released a free tool March 25 for visualizing the changing history of a document or directory of documents , called history flow .
the tool offers a variety of views of document histories , including a view that gives each revision equal importance , and a timeline view which displays each revision proportionally to how long it remained current .
each different editor who makes changes to the article has a distinct color , allowing for that editor ' s text to be tracked over time .
the tool was first developed in 2003 by a collaboration between Fernanda B. Viégas of the MIT Media Lab and Martin Wattenberg and Kushal Dave of IBM .
it was initially tested out on a large subset of the pages of Wikipedia , a free online encyclopedia project which preserves every change made to each of its articles .
the resulting paper was drafted in the winter of 2003 and presented at a conference in April 2004 ; it remains the most comprehensive overview of the lifecycle of articles in an active wiki community .
a year later , the history flow paper is still the most frequently cited source of statistics about the reversion of vandalism on Wikipedia .
the current tool is maintained by Martin Wattenberg and Jonathan Feinberg at IBM .
it allows users to download the text and histories of the contents of any MoinMoin wiki , or to view the history of the contents of an entire directory of documents .
the tool is free to download and use , but its code is not open source .
the support for MoinMoin wikis comes via a plugin , so the tool may be extensible to the native interfaces of other wiki engines in the future .

Republican candidates for President of the United States Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry have failed to qualify to be on the ballot for the Virginia primary election , scheduled for March 6 , Super Tuesday .
Gingrich , former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and Perry , Governor of Texas , did not submit the 10,000 signatures , with at least 400 from each of the state ' s eleven congressional districts , to the state ' s board of elections before the 5 : 00 PM deadline last Thursday required to gain ballot access , according to the Republican Party of Virginia .
Gingrich ' s and Perry ' s campaigns both claimed to have more signatures than needed , 11,050 and 11,911 respectively .
volunteers spent last night reviewing the submitted petitions and validating signatures .
reportedly Rick Perry is considering an appeal of the assessment .
among other major candidates for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination , former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney and Texas congressman Ron Paul submitted the required petition and qualified for the ballot .
on Thursday , it was disclosed that candidates Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum also failed to gain ballot access .
according to the manager of the Gingrich campaign , Michael Krull , the former House Speaker plans to compete in the Virginia primary , despite not gaining ballot access , as a write-in candidate .
Krull blamed a `` failed system ' ' for the campaign ' s inability to gain ballot access .
Rick Perry ' s campaign manager said he was disappointed by that campaign ' s failure to qualify for the ballot .
according to a recent poll of 489 Republican voters by Quinnipiac University , Gingrich leads in the state with 30 % of support , followed by Mitt Romney at 25 % and Ron Paul at 9 % .
as Virginia ' s delegates to the Republican National Convention are not awarded on a winner-take-all basis , candidates other than the winner of the state ' s primary could also gain delegates from the state .
North Korea ' s official news agency is reporting that the country has finished removing all its spent nuclear fuel rods , over 8,000 of them , from the main reactor in the Yongbyon nuclear plant .
the rods could be reprocessed for several months to extract weapons-grade plutonium .
officials say the rods could be able to provide enough plutonium to make two nuclear bombs .
this could possibly signal that North Korea is preparing for a nuclear arms test .
North Korea may already have enough materials to make six nuclear bombs .
North Korea has also announced plans to continue operating the Yongbyon facility , as well as to begin construction on a larger reactor .

Renault driver Fernando Alonso won the FIA Formula-1 2006 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix on the Suzuka International Racing Course .
though Ferrari drivers Felipe Massa and Michael Schumacher started the race from the first row , Alonso managed to overtake both Toyotas on the first part of the race and Massa after the pit stops .
then Alonso started to push on Michael Schumacher and closed the gap to about 5 seconds .
an engine failure forced Schumacher to park his car after the tunnel on lap 36 and the Spaniard rushed to his seventh victory in this season .
Giancarlo Fisichella , Fernando ' s teammate , had a bad start , but burst through Toyota and finished on the back of the second-placed Filipe Massa .
Toyota drivers Jarno Trulli and Ralf Schumacher lost even more positions , when Honda driver Jenson Button and McLaren Mercedes driver Kimi Räikkönen slipped in front of them and finished on 4-th and 5-th place respectively .
the situation in the drivers ' championship became almost critical for Schumacher , who lost 10 points this week-end .
only one chance remains for Schumacher to win his eighth champion ' s title - if he wins the final 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix and Alonso does n 't score any points .
`` I have to say clearly I do n 't really believe in the championship anymore , ' ' was Schumacher ' s reaction .
there remains a battle for the third place in drivers ' championship , where Massa has a one point lead ahead of Fisichella .
in the constructor ' s championship Renault is 9 points ahead of Ferrari .
a circus elephant managed to escape from her handler on Sunday night in the city of Zurich , Switzerland before being recaptured by local police and circus animal keepers .
the 26-year-old female elephant , named Sabu , is from Switzerland ' s Zirkus Knie .
she was able to make her escape just before being put into a trailer , while the keeper was not paying attention .
around 1930 local time -LRB- 1730 UTC -RRB- , Sabu was seen wading in Lake Zurich for a short time before walking back onto city streets .
Zurich police said that Sabu wandered along the Bahnhofstrasse avenue of Zurich , which is known as the city ' s most exclusive shopping street .
she also passed by Zürich Hauptbahnhof -LRB- the city ' s main rail station -RRB- and Paradeplatz , a square of Bahnhofstrasse , where both Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG have headquarters .
for nearly an hour , police chased the elephant around the city before she was finally peacefully recaptured in the Talstrasse section of Zurich .
circus officials and police followed Sabu , but a circus spokesperson said that she did not respond to their calls .
Sabu was also said to have been moving so fast that police had difficulty keeping up with her .
at about 2000 local time -LRB- 1900 UTC -RRB- , a keeper was able to control the animal and load her onto a truck to take her to Winterthur , where the other circus animals were .
there were no reports of any damage or injuries during the incident , and although police held back onlookers , at least one bystander managed to capture video of the event .
the circus said that Sabu may have escaped after being frightened by storms near Zurich .
after returning to the circus , she was said to be tired , but `` pleased to be back . ' '
